  abstract      = {This work investigates the performance of the on-demand machine learning (ODML) algorithm introduced in Leal et al. ( Transp. Porous Media 133 (2), 161–204, 2020) when applied to different reactive transport problems in heterogeneous porous media. This approach was devised to accelerate the computationally expensive geochemical reaction calculations in reactive transport simulations. We demonstrate that even with a strong heterogeneity present, the ODML algorithm speeds up these calculations by one to three orders of magnitude. Such acceleration, in turn, significantly advances the entire reactive transport simulation. The performed numerical experiments are enabled by the novel coupling of two open-source software packages : Reaktoro (Leal 2015) and Firedrake (Rathgeber et al. ACM Trans. Math. Softw. 43 (3), 2016). The first library provides the most recent version of the ODML approach for the chemical equilibrium calculations, whereas, the second framework includes the newly implemented conservative Discontinuous Galerkin finite element scheme for the Darcy problem, i.e., the Stabilized Dual Hybrid Mixed (SDHM) method N{\'{u}}{\~{n}}ez et al.

  abstract     = {The most common method for preventing downhole oilfield scale formation is by applying a scale inhibitor squeeze treatment. In this process, a scale inhibitor solution is injected down a producer well into the near wellbore formation. Commonly, these scale inhibitor treatments are injected as aqueous solutions. However, there are certain situations where an aqueous based treatment is not desirable, such as where relative permeability effects, water blocking, fluid lifting, chemical penetration or hydrate formation are of major concern.This two-phase flow multi-component, multi-layer, radial near-wellbore simulator is capable of modelling both aqueous and non-aqueous squeeze treatments. It considers the immiscible displacement of non-aqueous and aqueous phases, along with chemical component transport in both phases and mass transfer between both phases, and it is capable of modelling kinetic and equilibrium adsorption and desorption. It has been developed to study and optimise non-aqueous squeeze treatments. Of particular interest is the relationship between scale inhibitor chemical solubility in the carrier and in situ phases, and the choice of phase for the overflush fluid. The relationship can have a very pronounced impact on inhibitor penetration and squeeze lifetimes.Finally, the simulator was used to simulate a series of polymer non-aqueous scale inhibitor squeeze treatments deployed in the Heidrun field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. The simulation study consisted in matching the well water cut for the time of the treatments, followed by the derivation of a pseudo-adsorption isotherm, which is used to describe the SI retention in the formation. The initial pseudo-adsorption isotherm, derived from the first field treatment return concentration profile, resulted in very good matches for the other two consecutive treatments. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract     = {Squeeze treatments are one of the most common methods to prevent oilfield scale deposition, which in turn is one of the most significant flow assurance challenges in the oil industry. Squeeze treatments consist of the batch injection of a chemical scale inhibitor (SI), which above a certain concentration, commonly known as MIC (Minimum Inhibitor Concentration), prevents scale deposition. The most important factor in a squeeze treatment design is the squeeze lifetime, which is determined by the volume of water or days of production where the chemical return concentration is above MIC, which commonly is between 1 and 20ppm. Typically, squeeze treatment designs include the following four stages: a preflush, acting as a buffer; the main slug, where the main chemical slug is injected; the overflush, which will displaced the chemical pill deeper into the formation and finally, a shut-in stage, which allows the chemical to be further retained in the formation. The main purpose of this paper is to describe the automatic optimization of squeeze treatment designs using an optimization algorithm, in particular, using particle swarm optimization (PSO). The algorithm provides the optimum design for a given set of criteria that are used in a purpose built reactive transport model of the near-wellbore area. Every squeeze design is fully determined by a number of parameters; namely, injected inhibitor concentration, main slug volume, overflush volume and shut-in time. The parameter space is bound to certain limits, which will be determined by the maximum injected concentration, main slug and overflush volumes. The maximum injected concentration might be determined by, amongst other issues, logistics, economics and/or compatibility with other chemicals. The main slug and overflush maximum volumes may be identified by the well engineer based on concerns of water formation damage, hydrate formation and/or gas lifting limitations, which might be lower for high value wells. This approach still requires engineering input and review, but speeds up the process of finding an optimum design, and reduces risk of non-optimal squeeze treatments being performed.},

  abstract     = {Phosphonates are important compounds in water treatment, research, and medicine. The acid-base and alkaline-earth metal ion complex solution chemistry of the polyphosphonate diethylenetriaminepentakis-(methylenephosphonic acid) (DTPMP) has been determined up to 2 m ionic strength and from 25 to 90 °C. The phosphonate acid-base and metal complex stability constants were modeled with a simple polymer type model permitting the solution chemistry to be viewed either as a polymer or as discrete steps. This facilitates interpretation and comparison with previously published discrete constants. Two of the three sp3-hybridized nitrogen atoms are protonated first with stability constants K1N = 1012.58±0.05 and K2N = 1011.18±0.03; the third nitrogen is too weak of a base to be protonated under most solution conditions. The stepwise proton association constants of the phosphonate groups were modeled with the following one parameter model: log(Ki) = bH+|qi−1|, where Ki is the ith proton association constant (molality), |qi−1| is the value of the charge on the (i−1)th species, and bH+ was found to be about 1.04 with slight ionic strength and temperature dependence. A one-parameter model has been used to describe multiple metal complexation stability constants: log(Ki,j) = bM2+|qi,j−1|, where |qi,j−1| is the value of the charge on the phosphonate species, HiMj−1Phn and bM2+ was found to be about 0.63, again with small dependence on ionic strength and temperature. Results are shown to be consistent with the electrostatic theory of complex formation. These results have been used to establish the existence of a new and highly insoluble calcium phosphonate phase. Applications of these results to other metals and phosphonates are discussed along with several practical examples. {\textcopyright} 1994, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {Phosphonates are an important class of mineral scale inhibitors used for oilfield scale control. By injecting the phosphonate into an oilfield reservoir, calcium-phosphonate precipitate will form and subsequently release the phosphonate into produced water for scale control. In this study, a systematic procedure is developed to mechanistically characterize an acidic calcium-phosphonate amorphous material that is later developed into a middle phase and eventually a crystalline phase. The phosphonate used in this study is diethylenetriamine pentakis (methylene phosphonic acid) (DTPMP). An amorphous calcium-DTPMP solid is precipitated by mixing a calcium-containing solution with a DTPMP solution. The stoichiometry of this initially formed solid can be experimentally confirmed via a static dissolution test. Following another dynamic development test, two additional Ca-DTPMP solid phases, i.e., a middle phase and a crystalline phase have been observed. Electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction were employed to characterize the morphology and crystallinity of different Ca-DTPMP solids of interest. Evidently, the dynamic brine flushing of the Ca-DTPMP solid developed the initially amorphous material into a middle phase solid with an amorphous/microcrystalline structure and eventually into a crystalline material. Furthermore, a dissolution characterization study was carried out to determine the solubility product of the middle phase solid at different conditions. The obtained mechanistic understanding of the Ca-DTPMP solid related to precipitation chemistry, dissolution behavior and phase transition is critical to elucidate oilfield DTPMP return data and more importantly, can optimize the oilfield scale squeeze design to achieve an extended squeeze lifetime.},

  abstract     = {The bulk “apparent-adsorption” behavior (Capp vs. Cf) of two polymeric scale inhibitors (SIs), polyphosphino carboxylic acid (PPCA) and phosphorus-functionalized copolymer (PFC), onto carbonate mineral substrates has been studied for initial solution pH values of 2, 4, and 6. The two carbonate minerals used, calcite and dolomite, are much more chemically reactive than sandstone minerals (such as quartz, feldspars, and clays), which have already been studied extensively. In nearly all cases, precipitates formed at higher SI concentrations were caused by the formation of sparingly soluble SI/calcium (Ca) complexes. A systematic study has been performed on the SI/Ca precipitates formed by applying both environmental scanning electron microscopy energy-dispersive X-ray (ESEM-EDX) analysis and particle-size analysis (PSA), and this identifies the morphology and the approximate composition of the precipitates. For PPCA, at all initial solution pH values, regions of pure adsorption (C) (PPCA {\textless} 100 ppm) and coupled adsorption/precipitation (C/P) are clearly observed for both calcite and dolomite. PFC at pH values of 4 and 6 also showed very similar behavior, with a region of pure adsorption (C) for PFC {\textless} 500 ppm and a region of coupled adsorption/precipitation (C/P) above this level. However, the PFC/calcite case at pH ¼ 2 showed only pure adsorption, whereas the PFC/dolomite case at pH ¼ 2 again showed coupled adsorption/precipitation at higher PFC concentrations. For the SIs on both carbonate substrates, precipitation is the more dominant mechanism for SI retention than adsorption above a minimum concentration of approximately 100 to 500 ppm SI. The actual amount of precipitate formed varies from case to case, depending on the specific SI, the substrate (calcite/dolomite), and the initial pH (pH ¼ 2, 4, and 6). Although the qualitative behaviors of both PPCA and PFC were similar on both carbonate substrates, the apparent adsorption of PPCA was higher on calcite than on dolomite, and the apparent adsorption of PFC was higher on dolomite than on calcite. We discuss here how these observations are related to the reactivity of the different carbonate minerals, the resulting final pH (which affects the dissociation of the SI), the Ca-SI binding, and the solubility of the resulting complex.},

Results of bulk "apparent adsorption"(?app) experiments are presented for a widely used phosphonate SI, DETPMP, on calcite and dolomite mineral substrates. The apparent adsorption results are supported by (i) measuring the corresponding solution [Ca2+] and pH values in solution, (ii) studying the surface chemistry of the resulting SI/Ca precipitates using environmental scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray (ESEM-EDX) analysis to identify the morphology/composition of the SI/Ca precipitates, and (iii) a detailed mass balance analysis, indicating the fate of the Ca2+ and the SI. Results revealed that DETPMP was dominantly retained by both calcite and dolomite via a precipitation mechanism (actually coupled adsorption/precipitation) for all initial pH values (pH0 2, 4, and 6) and T = 95 °C, although a small region of pure adsorption (?) was observed at [DETPMP] {\textless} 100 ppm. Moreover, higher ?app occurred on dolomite than on calcite for all initial pH0. This result is counterintuitive, because it is well-known that calcite is much more reactive than dolomite. However, final equilibrium pH values are higher for dolomite, compared to calcite. Thus, a higher pHfinal led to a more dissociated DETPMP and this effect had a greater effect on SI/Ca precipitation than the higher [Ca2+] by rock dissolution. EDX analysis confirmed scale-inhibitor phosphorus in the deposited solids, indicating coupled adsorption/precipitation. Supporting mass balance calculations correlated very well with our experimental observations, showing higher generated calcium in calcite than dolomite and less calcium generation at higher initial pH0 (lower rock dissolution). Finally, an equilibrium mechanistic model describing the inhibitor dissociation, Ca-binding to the dissociated SI species, and precipitation of the SI{\_}Can complex, coupled to the carbonate system, is proposed to qualitatively explain these experimental findings.},

  abstract     = {The mechanistic understanding of the reactions that govern the inhibitor retention and release, modeling, and the state-of-the-art innovation in squeeze treatment are reviewed. The retention and release are governed by (1) the amount of calcite that can dissolve prior to inhibitor-induced surface poisoning; (2) calcite surface poisoning after {\~{}} 20 molecular layers of surface coverage by the adsorbed inhibitors to retard further calcite dissolution; (3) less base, CO32-, is released into the aqueous solution; (4) formation of the more acidic inhibitor precipitates; (5) phase transformation and maturation of the more acidic inhibitor precipitates; and (6) dissolution of the less soluble crystalline inhibitor precipitates. The trend to advance squeeze technologies is through (1) enhancing scale inhibitor retention, (2) optimizing the delivery of scale inhibitors to the target zone, and (3) improving monitoring methods. Lastly, a prototype yardstick for measuring the squeeze performance is used to compare the squeeze life of 17 actual squeeze treatments. Even though the various squeeze treatments appear to be different, all published squeeze durations can be rated based on the normalized squeeze life per unit mass of inhibitors.},

  abstract     = {The viscosity and density of aqueous solutions of carbon dioxide having mole fractions of CO2 of 0.0086, 0.0168, and 0.0271 are reported. The measurements were made in the single-phase compressed liquid region at temperatures between (294 and 449) K at pressures up to 100 MPa; additional density measurements were also made at T = 274 K in the same pressure range. The viscosity was measured with a vibrating-wire viscometer while the density was measured by means of a vibrating U-tube densimeter; both were calibrated with pure water and either vacuum or ambient air. The density data have an expanded relative uncertainty of 0.07 {\%} with a coverage factor of 2. From the raw data, the partial molar volume of CO2 in aqueous solution has been determined and correlated as an empirical function of temperature and pressure. When combined with the IAPWS-95 equation of state of pure water, this correlation represents the measured densities of under-saturated solutions of CO2 in water within ± 0.04 {\%}. The viscosity data have an expanded relative uncertainty of 1.4 {\%} with a coverage factor of 2. A modified Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman equation was used to correlate the viscosity as a function of temperature, pressure, and mole fraction of CO2 with an absolute average relative deviation of 0.4 {\%}. The viscosity and density of saturated aqueous solutions of CO2 may be calculated by combining the correlations presented in this work with a suitable model for the mole fraction of CO2 at saturation.

  abstract     = {The computer-enabled thermodynamic database associated with SUPCRT92 (Johnson et al., 1992) enables the calculation of the standard molal thermodynamic properties of minerals, gases, aqueous species, and reactions for a wide range of temperatures and pressures. However, new data on the thermodynamic properties of both aqueous species and minerals have become available since the database's initial release in 1992 and its subsequent updates. In light of these developments, we have expanded SUPCRT92's thermodynamic dataset and have modified the accompanying computer code for thermodynamic calculations by using newly available properties. The modifications in our new version include: (1) updating the standard state thermodynamic properties for mineral end-members with properties from Holland and Powell (2011) to improve the study of metamorphic petrology and economic geology; (2) adding As-acid, As-metal aqueous species, and As-bearing minerals to improve the study of environmental geology; (3) updating properties for Al-bearing species, SiO2°(aq) and HSiO3-, boehmite, gibbsite, and dawsonite for modeling geological carbon sequestration. The new thermodynamic dataset and the modified SUPCRT92 program were implemented in a software package called SUPCRTBL, which is available online at www.indiana.edu/{\~{}}hydrogeo/subcrtbl.html.},

  abstract     = {Interior methods are an omnipresent, conspicuous feature of the constrained optimization landscape today, but it was not always so. Primarily in the form of barrier methods, interior-point techniques were popular during the 1960s for solving nonlinearly constrained problems. However, their use for linear programming was not even contemplated because of the total dominance of the simplex method. Vague but continuing anxiety about barrier methods eventually led to their abandonment in favor of newly emerging, apparently more efficient alternatives such as augmented Lagrangian and sequential quadratic programming methods. By the early 1980s, barrier methods were almost without exception regarded as a closed chapter in the history of optimization. This picture changed dramatically with Karmarkar's widely publicized announcement in 1984 of a fast polynomial-time interior method for linear programming; in 1985, a formal connection was established between his method and classical barrier methods. Since then, interior methods have advanced so far, so fast, that their influence has transformed both the theory and practice of constrained optimization. This article provides a condensed, selective look at classical material and recent research about interior methods for nonlinearly constrained optimization.}

The performance of the sequential quadratic strategy using an exact Newton method and a linesearch method, implemented in this work for the specific resolution of Gibbs free energy minimization problems, is compared to the one of other large-scale optimization software packages: SNOPT, IPOPT, and KNITRO. Key subroutines implemented in the strategy to locate local minima, and specifically implemented to improve the convergence toward targeted local minima, are also presented in this work and highlight the robustness of our approach.},

  abstract     = {Research has shown that strong acids (i.e., sulfuric and nitric acids) may be produced as a result of reactions between impurities during CO2 transport within carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) systems even when today's impurity specifications and recommendations are followed. Strong acids are corrosive to carbon steel, which is a very common construction material for CO2 transport pipelines. To establish acceptable impurity limits and to ensure the integrity of pipelines, experimental data are needed as input for modeling possible scenarios and as a foundation for constructing modeling tools. To assess the possibility of formation of concentrated acid-bearing phases in CO2 environments, acid solubility in dense phase CO2 needs to be determined. The nitric and sulfuric acid solubilities in dense phase CO2 were determined by first saturating the CO2 phase with the acids and by subsequently scrubbing the acids using water-filled autoclaves. The water was then analyzed using ion chromatography. The experiments were conducted at two temperatures (25 and 48 °C) with four different pressures (80, 100, 120, and 170 bar). The new solubility measurements have been used in conjunction with available literature data to construct a thermodynamic model for predicting the thermodynamic behavior of acid-CO2 mixtures over wide ranges of temperatures, pressures, and compositions. The model is based on the previously developed Mixed-Solvent Electrolyte (MSE) framework and incorporates speciation and phase equilibria in CO2-rich as well as water-rich environments.},

  abstract     = {A large number of application problems involve two levels of optimization, where one optimization task is nested inside the other. These problems are known as bilevel optimization problems and have been studied by both classical optimization community and evolutionary optimization community. Most of the solution procedures proposed until now are either computationally very expensive or applicable to only small classes of bilevel optimization problems adhering to mathematically simplifying assumptions. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary optimization method that tries to reduce the computational expense by iteratively approximating two important mappings in bilevel optimization; namely, the lower level rational reaction mapping and the lower level optimal value function mapping. The algorithm has been tested on a large number of test problems and comparisons have been performed with other algorithms. The results show the performance gain to be quite significant. To the best knowledge of the authors, a combined theory-based and population-based solution procedure utilizing mappings has not been suggested yet for bilevel problems.},

  abstract     = {A review of coupled groundwater and heat transfer theory is followed by an introduction to geothermal measurement techniques. Thereafter, temperature-depth profiles (geotherms) and heat discharge at springs to infer hydraulic parameters and processes are discussed. Several studies included in this review state that minimum permeabilities of approximately 5×10−17 {\textless} k min {\textless}10−15 m2 are required to observe advective heat transfer and resultant geotherm perturbations. Permeabilities below k min tend to cause heat-conduction-dominated systems, precluding inversion of temperature fields for groundwater flow patterns and constraint of permeabilities other than being {\textless}k min. Values of k min depend on the flow-domain aspect-ratio, faults and other heterogeneities, anisotropy of hydraulic and thermal parameters, heat-flow rates, and the water-table shape. However, the k min range is narrow and located toward the lower third of geologic materials, which exhibit permeabilities of 10−21{\textless} k {\textless}10−7 m2. Therefore, a wide range of permeabilities can be investigated by analyzing subsurface temperatures or heat discharge at springs. Furthermore, temperature is easy and economical to measure and because thermal material properties vary far less than hydraulic properties, temperature measurements tend to provide better-constrained groundwater flow and permeability estimates. Aside from hydrogeologic insights, constraint of advective/conductive heat transfer can also provide information on magmatic intrusions, metamorphism, ore deposits, climate variability, and geothermal energy.},

The method of mathematical programming was used to achieve consistency of derived properties with phase equilibrium, calorimetric, and volumetric data, utilizing equations that account for the thermodynamic consequences of first and second order phase transitions, and temperature-dependent disorder. Tabulated properties are in good agreement with thermophysical data, as well as being consistent with the bulk of phase equilibrium data obtained in solubility studies, weight change experiments, and reversals involving both single and mixed volatile species. The reliability of the thermodynamic data set is documented by extensive comparisons (Figs. 4‚{\"{A}}{\`{i}}45) between computed equilibria and phase equilibrium data. The high degree of consistency obtained with these diverse experimental data gives confidence that the refined thermodynamic properties should allow accurate prediction of phase relationships among stoichiometric minerals in complex chemical systems, and provide a reasonable basis from which activity models for minerals may be derived.}

Inverse-modelling tasks (ii) and (iii) can be performed when the solid solution of interest is shown experimentally to co-exist with the aqueous phase either in the equilibrium or at the minimum stoichiometric saturation state. DualTh calculations exploit the ability of Gibbs energy minimisation (GEM) algorithms to find simultaneously two numerical solutions of the isobaric-isothermal chemical equilibrium speciation problem: (1) primal solution x - A vector of amounts of components (species) in phases; and (2) dual solution u - A vector of chemical potentials of stoichiometry units (usually chemical elements and charge). Conversely, the chemical potential of a phase component can be found in two complementary ways: (i) primal via its standard-state potential, concentration and activity coefficient (the latter two are functions of the x vector); and (ii) dual through its formula stoichiometry multiplied by the u vector. The DualTh methods compare primal and dual values of the chemical potential in simple and straightforward equations that can be easily computed in a spreadsheet, or implemented in GEM geochemical modelling codes. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In a previous paper, the authors introduced an inexpensive approximate solution technique for this problem that involves the solution of a two-dimensional trust region problem. They showed that using this approximation in an unconstrained optimization algorithm leads to the same theoretical global and local convergence properties as are obtained using the exact solution to the trust region problem. This paper reports computational results showing that the two-dimensional minimization approach gives nearly optimal reductions in the n -dimension quadratic model over a wide range of test cases. We also show that there is very little difference, in efficiency and reliability, between using the approximate or exact trust region step in solving standard test problems for unconstrained optimization. These results may encourage the application of similar approximate trust region techniques in other contexts.},

The data are systematized by using the high temperature Birch-Murnaghan equation of state which includes the pressure and temperature dependent bulk modulus (K) and temperature dependent thermal expansion ($\alpha$) of the solids. The systematized thermodynamic data contains heat capacity (Cp) data, which is internally consistent with the data on $\alpha$, K, volume, and temperature. Such a systematized database is used to calculate, by the method of minimization of Gibbs free energy, the mineralogical composition of the peridotitic/pyrolitic and chondritic MgO-FeO-SiO2 mantles.

  abstract     = {Petrological and geochemical observations of pegmatites in the Strange Lake pluton, Canada, have been combined with numerical simulations to improve our understanding of fluid-rock interaction in peralkaline granitic systems. In particular, they have made it possible to evaluate reaction paths responsible for hydrothermal mobilization and mineralization of rare earth elements (REE) and Zr. The focus of the study was the B-Zone in the northwest of the pluton, which contains a pegmatite swarm and is the target of exploration for an economically exploitable REE deposit. Many of the pegmatites are mineralogically zoned into a border consisting of variably altered primary K-feldspar, arfvedsonite, quartz, and zirconosilicates, and a core rich in quartz, fluorite and exotic REE minerals. Textural relationships indicate that the primary silicate minerals in the pegmatites were leached and/or replaced during acidic alteration by K-, Fe- and Al-phyllosilicates, aegirine, hematite, fluorite and/or quartz, and that primary zirconosilicates (e.g., elpidite) were replaced by gittinsite and/or zircon. Reaction textures recording coupled dissolution of silicate minerals and crystallization of secondary REE-silicates indicate hydrothermal mobilization of the REE. The mobility of the light (L)REE was limited by the stability of REE-F-(CO2)-minerals (basn{\"{a}}site-(Ce) and fluocerite-(Ce)), whereas zirconosilicates and secondary gadolinite-group minerals controlled the mobility of Zr and the heavy (H)REE. Hydrothermal fluorite and fluorite-fluocerite-(Ce) solid solutions are interpreted to indicate the former presence of F-bearing saline fluids in the pegmatites. Numerical simulations show that the mobilization of REE and Zr in saline HCl-HF-bearing fluids is controlled by pH, ligand activity and temperature. Mobilization of Zr is significant in both saline HF- and HCl-HF-bearing fluids at low temperature (250°C). In contrast, the REE are mobilized by saline HCl-bearing fluids, particularly at high temperature (400°C). The LREE are more mobile than the HREE in saline HCl-bearing fluids due to the greater stability of LREE-chloride complexes. The simulated mineralogy is consistent with the zonation observed in the pegmatites and with fluid-rock interaction at conditions that were rock-buffered in the pegmatite borders (low fluid/rock ratio; and pH{\textgreater}4) and fluid-buffered in the cores (high fluid/rock ratio; pH≤2). We propose a model in which saline HCl-HF-bearing fluids created pathways during acidic alteration from the pegmatite cores outward. This led to the mobilization of REE and Zr due to progressive alteration of primary silicate minerals and increased acidity upon cooling. The key requirement for REE and Zr mobilization in peralkaline igneous intrusions is the formation of an acidic subsystem with high fluid/rock ratios that increases the overall permeability of the rocks. In these zones, the extent of late stage hydrothermal redistribution and concentration of REE and Zr depends on the buffering capacity of the rocks and the availability of fluids that may produce autometasomatic rock alteration, interact with external rock units and/or mix with fluids from other sources. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.}

  abstract     = {The rare earth elements (REE) are critical metals that play a major role in emerging high technology and green industries. The light (L)REE occur dominantly in fluorocarbonate minerals and consequently information on the stability of these minerals is essential for a better understanding of the genesis of REE deposits and for the efficient processing of their ores. We have investigated the thermochemical properties of natural bastn??site-(Ce) (Ce0.50La0.25Nd0.20Pr0.05CO3F) and parisite-(Ce) (CaCe0.95La0.60Nd0.35Pr0.10(CO3)3F2) using differential scanning calorimetry at temperatures from 323K to 1022K and a pressure of 1bar employing heat ramping and isothermal methods. Crystal lattice parameters of the REE fluorocarbonate minerals and reaction products from the experiments were determined using X-ray diffraction. The measured isobaric heat capacity (Cp??) for bastn??site-(Ce) can be described by the relationship 134.3-2.032??106T-2 between 343.15 and 528.15K and for parisite-(Ce) by the relationship 398.8-1048T-0.5-4.202??106T-2 between 343.15 and 643.15K, where T is temperature in K. Bastn??site-(Ce) decomposed irreversibly at {\textgreater}612K to form REE oxyfluorides and CO2. An endothermic peak at 824.2K yielded a heat of reaction of 245.2??2.5kJ/mol. Parisite-(Ce) decomposed irreversibly at {\textgreater}664K to form REE oxyfluorides, CaCO3 and CO2. An endothermic peak at 842.7K yielded a heat of reaction of 522.6??5.2kJ/mol. The enthalpy of formation at 298K and 1bar was retrieved from the decomposition enthalpies, yielding -1808.4??12.0kJ/mol and -4848.0??23.8kJ/mol for bastn??site-(Ce) and parisite-(Ce), respectively. The measured molar volumes for bastn??site-(Ce) and parisite-(Ce) are 42.91cm3/mol and 122.71cm3/mol, respectively. An estimation method, based on the dependence of entropy on volume, was used to retrieve the third law entropy (S??) at 298.15K, and together with the measured thermodynamic properties, permitted us to construct the first quantitative mineral-fluid stability diagrams involving bastn??site-(Ce), parisite-(Ce), fluocerite-(Ce), calcite and fluorite at P-T-x conditions relevant for the study of natural Ca-REE-C-O-H-F systems. Further studies of the thermodynamic properties of REE-bearing minerals are urgently needed to better understand the genesis of REE ore deposits.},

A series of experiments examines the effects of host-rock permeability, size and depth of pluton emplacement, single versus multiple intrusions, the influence of a caprock, and the impact of topographically driven groundwater flow. We also reproduce and evaluate some of the pioneering numerical experiments on flow around plutons. Host-rock permeability is the principal factor influencing fluid circulation and heat transfer in hydrothermal systems. The hottest and most steam-rich systems develop where permeability is of the order of 10-15 m2. Temperatures and life spans of systems decrease with increasing permeability. Conduction-dominated systems, in which permeabilities are ≤10-16m2, persist longer but exhibit relatively modest increases in near-surface temperatures relative to ambient conditions. Pluton size, emplacement depth, and initial thermal conditions have less influence on hydrothermal circulation patterns but affect the extent of boiling and duration of hydrothermal systems. Topographically driven groundwater flow can significantly alter hydrothermal circulation; however, a low-permeability caprock effectively decouples the topographically and density-driven systems and stabilizes the mixing interface between them thereby defining a likely ore-forming environment.},

  abstract     = {The rate-controlled constrained-equilibrium (RCCE) method for simplifying the kinetics of complex reacting systems is reviewed. This method is based on the maximum entropy principle of thermodynamics and involves the assumption that the evolution of a system can be described using a relatively small set of slowly changing constraints imposed by the external and internal dynamics of the system. As a result, the number of differential and algebraic equations required to determine the constrained-equilibrium state of a system can be very much smaller than the number of species in the system. It follows that only reactions which change constraints are required to determine the dynamic evolution of the system and all other reactions are in equilibrium. The accuracy of the method depends on both the character and number of constraints employed and issues involved in the selection and transformation of the constraints are discussed. A method for determining the initial conditions for highly non-equilibrium systems is also presented. The method is illustrated by applying it to the oxidation of methane (CH4), methanol (CH3OH), and formaldehyde (CH2O) in a constant volume adiabatic chamber over a wide range of initial temperatures, pressures, and equivalence ratios. The RCCE calculations were carried out using 8-12 constraints and 133 reactions. Good agreement with "Detailed Kinetic Model" (DMK) calculations using 29 species and 133 reactions was obtained. The number of reactions in the RCCE calculations could be reduced to 20 for CH4, 16 for CH3OH, and 12 for CH2O without changing the results significantly affecting the agreement. It may be noted that a DKM with 29 species requires a minimum of 29 reactions. ?? 2009 The Combustion Institute.},

  abstract     = {The development of highly accurate and computationally efficient modeling software based on Gibbs energy minimization (GEM) makes it possible to thermodynamically simulate geochemically realistic subsurface fluid-rock interaction processes. This involves consideration of non-ideal multicomponent-multiphase systems that include dilute to concentrated aqueous electrolyte solutions, mineral solid solutions, supercritical fluids, silicate and metal melts, and sorption and ion exchange phases. Predicting the stability and thermodynamic properties of non-ideal solution phases over wide ranges of pressures and temperatures requires that theoretically sound and sufficiently accurate equation of state and activity models are used within the GEM framework. The variety of such models calls for a novel, flexible, and computationally efficient code architecture that supports a wide range of models of non-ideal mixing with different mathematical structures and input data. Here, we introduce the TSolMod C++ class library for equation of state and activity models, implemented within the GEMS3K solver of geochemical equilibria as part of the GEM-Selektor code package (http://gems.web.psi.ch). Essential features of the TSolMod library include a generic and flexible model parameter setup, computationally efficient data exchange with the GEM algorithm, and a straightforward extensibility with any new models of mixing. The current version of TSolMod features a comprehensive selection of fluid, gas, liquid, and solid solution models of interest for geochemical, petrological, material science, and chemical engineering applications.},

It was first published in print in 1984, approximately 8 years after it was first assembled, and contained 215 species at the time. This is the 7th printed edition and most likely will be the last one in print in the present format, which involves substantial manual labor. The database currently contains more than 1300 species, specifically organic molecules and radicals, but also inorganic species connected to combustion and air pollution. Since 1991 this database is freely available on the internet, at the Technion-IIT ftp server, and it is continuously expanded and corrected. The database is mirrored daily at an official mirror site, and at random at about a dozen unofficial mirror and “finger” sites. The present edition contains numerous corrections and many recalculations of data of provisory type by the G3//B3LYP method, a high-accuracy composite ab initio calculation. About 300 species are newly calculated and are not yet published elsewhere. In anticipation of the full coupling, which is under development, the database started incor- porating the available (as yet unpublished) values from Active Thermochemical Tables. The electronic version now also contains an XML file of the main database to allow transfer to other formats and ease finding specific information of interest. The database is used by scientists, educators, engineers and students at all levels, dealing primarily with combustion and air pollution, jet engines, rocket propulsion, fireworks, but also by researchers involved in upper atmosphere kinetics, astrophysics, abrasion metallurgy, etc. This introductory article contains explanations of the database and the means to use it, its sources, ways of calculation, and assessments of the accuracy of data.},

  abstract     = {A thermodynamic model calculating the solubility of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in pure water and in aqueous NaCl solutions (0−6 M, 273−500 K, 0−200 bar) is presented. The model is based on a specific particle interaction theory for the liquid phase and a highly accurate equation of state for the vapor phase. With this specific interaction approach, this model is able to predict H2S solubility in other systems, such as H2S−H2O−Na2SO4, H2S−H2O−CaCl2, H2S−H2O−KCl, and H2S−seawater, without fitting experimental data from these systems. Comparison of the model predictions with experimental data indicates that the model is within or close to experimental uncertainty, which is about 7{\%} in H2S solubility. The model is programmed and can be downloaded from the website: www.geochem-model.org/programs.htm. Online calculation is also made available on the website: www.geochem-model.org/models.htm. The H2S solubility model can be used together with numerical speciation-solubility modeling codes such as PHREEQC to calculate sulfide mineral solubility in H2S saturated brines. An example calculation for galena solubility is given.}

The resulting version of the Nagra/PSI TDB Ol/Ol is called Nagra/PSI TDB Ol/Ol GEMS. The original Nagra/PSI TDB Ol/Ol was designed to be used with geochemical modeling codes that apply the law of mass action algorithm. The essential thermodynamic data at standard conditions (1 bar, 25{\textgreater}C) are equilibrium constants (logl0K{\textgreater}) for the formation reactions of product species from master species. GEM-Selektor is a geochemical modeling code based on a Gibbs energy minimization algorithm. The essential thermodynamic data are molar Gibbs energies of formation from the elements ( {\{}G{\textgreater}) for all chemical species. The main task in porting the Nagra/PSI TDB 01/Ol to GEMS was to derive tG{\textgreater} of each aqueous species, solid, and gas from the equilibrium constant of its formation reaction and fG{\textgreater} of all master species taking part in that reaction. Thus, any logl0K{\textgreater} contained in the Nagra/PSI TDB Ol/Ol is perfectly reproducible at l bar and 25{\textgreater}C by using the appropriate values of tG{\textgreater} derived in this report. Additional data given in order to extend calculation of chemical equilibria to elevated temperatures should not be considered as part of the official Nagra/PSI TDB Ol/Ol GEMS. The official data are restricted to the minimal set required for the calculation of chemical equilibria at standard conditions (25{\textgreater}C and l bar). These are the fG{\textgreater} values for DComp records and the logmK{\textgreater} and 1G{\textgreater} values for ReacDC records}},

This equivalence allows us to use the favorable theoretical results of Griewank (1981), Nesterov and Polyak (2006), and Cartis et.al. (2011).

The model combines a thermodynamic model that provides realistic speciation of aqueous systems with an electrochemical model for partial cathodic and anodic processes on the metal surface. The electrochemical model includes the adsorption of halides, which strongly influences the corrosion process. Also, the model takes into account the formation of passive films, which become important at high temperatures, at which the refrigeration equipment operates. The model has been verified by comparing calculated corrosion rates with laboratory data for carbon steels in LiBr solutions. Good agreement between the calculated and experimental corrosion rates has been obtained. In particular, the model is capable of reproducing the effects of changes in alkalinity and molybdate concentration on the rates of general corrosion. The model has been incorporated into a program that makes it possible to analyze the effects of various conditions such as temperature, pressure, solution composition or flow velocity on corrosion rates.},

To universally and globally utilize these immense resources exciting R{\&}D problems need to be tackled: 1) Development of a technology to produce electricity and/or heat from a basically ubiquitous resource, independent of site subsurface conditions (“EGS technology”); 2) Acquiring experience about possible changes of an EGS heat exchanger with time; 3) Upscaling EGS power plant capacity from the currently few MWe to several 10 – 100 MWe.}

  abstract     = {The relative importance index (RII) method for determining appropriate target species for dynamic adaptive chemistry (DAC) simulations using the directed relation graph with error propagation (DRGEP) method is developed. The adequacy and effectiveness of this RII method is validated for two fuels: n-heptane and isopentanol, representatives of a ground transportation fuel component and bio-alcohol, respectively.The conventional method of DRGEP target species selection involves picking an unchanging (static) set of target species based on the combustion processes of interest; however, these static target species may not remain important throughout the entire combustion simulation, adversely affecting the accuracy of the method. In particular, this behavior may significantly reduce the accuracy of the DRGEP-based DAC approach in complex multidimensional simulations where the encountered combustion conditions cannot be known a priori with high certainty. Moreover, testing multiple sets of static target species to ensure the accuracy of the method is generally computationally prohibitive. Instead, the RII method determines appropriate DRGEP target species solely from the local thermo-chemical state of the simulation, ensuring that accuracy will be maintained. Further, the RII method reduces the expertise required of users to select DRGEP target species sets appropriate to the combustion phenomena under consideration.Constant volume autoignition simulations run over a wide range of initial conditions using detailed reaction mechanisms for n-heptane and isopentanol show that the RII method is able to maintain accuracy even when traditional static target species sets fail, and are even more accurate than expert-selected target species sets. Additionally, the accuracy and efficiency of the RII method are compared to those of static target species sets in single-cell engine simulations under homogeneous charge compression ignition conditions. For simulations using more stringent DRGEP thresholds, the RII method performs similarly to that of the static target species sets. With a larger DRGEP threshold, the RII method is significantly more accurate than the static target species sets without imposing significant computational overhead.Furthermore, the applicability of the RII method to a DRG-based DAC scheme is discussed.},

  abstract     = {Speciation is the process of evaluating the concentrations of all the species in a chemical system from equilibrium conditions and measured data such as total concentrations of components, electrical conductivity, pH, redox potential or gas partial pressure. It is essential for analyzing geochemical data and defining the chemical composition of waters for geochemical modeling problems like evaluating the chemical composition of evaporating, diluting, mixing waters or reactive transport. We present an algorithm that reduces estimation errors in chemical speciation calculations by means of the use of redundant data. Redundant data are measurements and assumptions that exceed the minimum required, and therefore are not strictly necessary, to speciate a water sample. The proposed method was compared with the classical speciation algorithm on two synthetic examples. Our results show that using redundant data improves speciation results reducing the estimation error between computations and measurements. In fact, the larger the amount of redundant data, the better the speciation in terms of errors of the estimated concentrations.},

  abstract     = {A Gibbs energy minimization (GEM) approach to calculate chemical equilibria involving surface complexation at the mineral-water interfaces is presented, permitting the whole continuum “aqueous speciation - heterogeneous adsorption - surface (co)precipitation - solid solution” to be modeled only in elemental stoichiometry, without additional material balance constraints for the total number of surface sites. The thermodynamic stability of surface-bound species is considered in a way similar to that of the solid-solution endmembers, gases, and aqueous species. This consideration is made possible by introducing: (1) the standard and reference states of surface species involving a single value of reference site density $\Gamma$o; (2) an expression of (electro)chemical potential linking quantities of the surface species with the amount and specific surface area of the sorbent; (3) activity/concentration relationships between aqueous sorbates and surface species, based on the surface activity terms (SAT) as functions of the maximum site densities $\Gamma$max; (4) the surface type area fractions $\phi$$\alpha$,t for describing faces or patches on heterogeneous surface of multi-site-surface sorption mineral phases; (5) an elemental stoichiometry and standard partial molal properties of the amphoteric neutral surface functional group ≡OH and derived surface complexes at ambient conditions, comparable between all (hydr)oxide mineral surfaces. For the ;OH group (in 2pKA surface complexation models), a O0.5Ho stoichiometry is conventionally defined from a reaction 0.5H2Oaq = {\textgreater}O0.5Ho, with logKn = 1.74436 (at = 20 $\mu$mol {\textperiodcentered} m−2) which is independent of temperature, pressure, pH, fO2, amount and specific surface area of the sorbent, aqueous speciation, and surface speciation. It follows that all the non-reacted {\textgreater}O0.5Ho groups have constant activity in the presence of liquid H2O and are thus macroscopically indistinguishable. The surface heterogeneity is described via standard thermodynamic properties of the surface complexes (reacted groups), such as “surface hydronium” {\textgreater}O0.5H2+, “surface hydroxyl” {\textgreater}O0.5−, adsorbed cations or anions, as well as through $\phi$$\alpha$,t and the common or individual $\Gamma$t,max parameters. Theoretical findings, implemented in the GEM-Selektor code, are illustrated by modeling the literature potentiometric titration and adsorption data for silica and rutile in NaCl solutions with the triple-layer (TLM), the generalized double-layer (DLM), and the non-electrostatic (NEM) surface complexation models (SCM). Some examples were also calculated with the FITEQL3.2 code to check for compatibility. It is shown: (1) how approximate conversions between partial molal properties of surface species and intrinsic adsorption constants can be performed for different total site densities $\Gamma$C ≠ $\Gamma$o; (2) what are the regions of “geometrically ideal” and “non-ideal” adsorption behavior for the chosen SCM and how they are controlled by the SAT = f($\Gamma$max) on heterogeneous surfaces; and (3) why different sets of TLM parameters are not thermodynamically equivalent, and how a meaningful “optimal” set can be determined from titration data. Due to the separation of $\Gamma$max parameters from $\Gamma$o and, hence, from thermodynamic constants, the thermodynamic SCMs (in GEM implementation) can provide more insight into the relationships between surface types, complexes, bulk mineral sorbent, and aqueous sorbates, therefore permitting a more thorough use of microscopic/spectroscopic data in sorption modeling than has ever been possible.}

  abstract     = {The mineral assemblage of a cement paste may vary considerably with its environment. In addition, the water content of a cement paste is relatively low and the ionic strength of the interstitial solution is often high. These conditions are extreme conditions with respect to the common assumptions made in speciation problem. Furthermore the common trial and error algorithm to find the phase assemblage does not provide any guarantee of convergence. We propose a speciation solver based on a semismooth Newton method adapted to the thermodynamic modeling of cement paste. The strong theoretical properties associated with these methods offer practical advantages. Results of numerical experiments indicate that the algorithm is reliable, robust, and efficient.},

  abstract     = {The propagation of grassland fires is simulated using a fully physical based model, partially developed during the FIRESTAR European Union programme. This approach, based on a multiphase formulation, includes the calculation of the degradation of the vegetation (by dehydration and pyrolysis) and the turbulent/reactive flow resulting from the mixing between the ambient gas (wind flow) and the pyrolizate. The solid fuel is simulated as homogeneous distribution of solid particles forming a porous media, interacting with the gas flow using a continuous distribution of drag forces. Other source terms representing the interactions between the vegetation and the gas flow are also taken into account, such as the production of water vapour and gaseous fuel, the radiation of soot particles and ashes, and the convective exchange in the energy balance. The model was validated from preliminary calculations carried out at small scale, for a homogeneous fuel bed (pine needles, excelsior, sticks) and compared with experimental results obtained in a wind tunnel. Calculations are then extended to study the propagation of fires through a flat grassland, for various wind speed conditions. The numerical results are compared to empirical and semi-empirical predictions obtained in similar conditions.},

  abstract     = {During reactive transport modeling, the computational cost associated with chemical reaction calculations is often 10-100 times higher than that of transport calculations. Most of these costs results from chemical equilibrium calculations that are performed at least once in every mesh cell and at every time step of the simulation. Calculating chemical equilibrium is an iterative process, where each iteration is in general so computationally expensive that even if every calculation converged in a single iteration, the resulting speedup would not be significant. Thus, rather than proposing a fast-converging numerical method for solving chemical equilibrium equations, we present a machine learning method that enables new equilibrium states to be quickly and accurately estimated, whenever a previous equilibrium calculation with similar input conditions has been performed. We demonstrate the use of this smart chemical equilibrium method in a reactive transport modeling example and show that, even at early simulation times, the majority of all equilibrium calculations are quickly predicted and, after some time steps, the machine-learning-accelerated chemical solver has been fully trained to rapidly perform all subsequent equilibrium calculations, resulting in speedups of almost two orders of magnitude. We remark that our new on-demand machine learning method can be applied to any case in which a massive number of sequential/parallel evaluations of a computationally expensive function {\$}f{\$} needs to be done, {\$}y=f(x){\$}. We remark, that, in contrast to traditional machine learning algorithms, our on-demand training approach does not require a statistics-based training phase before the actual simulation of interest commences. The introduced on-demand training scheme requires, however, the first-order derivatives {\$}\backslashpartial f/\backslashpartial x{\$} for later smart predictions.},

The diagrams are based on a thermodynamic model that combines the Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers equation of state for standard-state properties with a solutions nonideality model based on the activity coefficient expressions developed by Bromley and Pitzer. The diagrams offer a flexible choice of independent variables, which include component concentrations in addition to the potential and pH. The stability diagrams are used to predict the conditions that favor the formation of stable and metastable iron sulfide species, which are commonly deposited under oil field-related conditions. First, the diagrams have been applied to establish a sequence of transformations that iron sulfides undergo as they age. The predicted transformation sequences take into account environmental variables (e.g., hydrogen sulfide concentration, oxygen availability, etc.). The predictions are in agreement with experimental data on iron sulfide formation at the iron/solution interface and in bulk solution. The understanding of iron sulfide transformation sequences makes it possible to simulate experimental studies of H2S/CO2 corrosion in the presence or absence of oxygen. A comparison with laboratory corrosion rate data under gas pipeline conditions indicates that the magnitude of corrosion rates can be correlated with the predicted stability of metastable iron sulfide phases.},

For mixtures of solvents without electrolyte components, the model is based on an empirical modification of the Kirkwood theory for multicomponent systems. For systems containing electrolytes, the model takes into account the effects of ions and ion pairs and, therefore, it is capable of reproducing the dependence of the dielectric constant on electrolyte concentration. For most solvent mixtures, dielectric constants can be reasonably predicted using only pure solvent properties. In the case of strongly nonideal solvent mixtures, the results can be significantly improved by adjusting a single binary parameter. The model has also been verified for a number of electrolyte solutions in various solvents over wide composition and temperature ranges. In particular, the increase in the dielectric constant due to ion pairing and its decrease due to the presence of ions and their solvation can be accurately represented.

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of contaminant migration in surface and ground water bodies, including interaction with aquifer and hyporheic zone materials requires reactive transport modeling. The increasing complexity and the procedure-oriented type of programming often used in reactive transport hinder codes reuse and transportability. We present a Fortran 90 module using object-oriented concepts that simulates complex hydrobiogeochemical processes (CHEPROO, CHEmical PRocesses Object-Oriented). CHEPROO consists of a general structure with two classes. The Nodal Chemistry class accounts for the description of local chemistry and geochemical state variables. As such, it provides many functions related to basic operations (evaporation, mixing, etc.) and can easily grow on this direction (extreme dry conditions, biochemical state variables, etc.). The Chemical System class includes kinetic and thermodynamic models that describe reactions between and within phases. As such, it can grow in the direction of increasingly complex chemical systems (solid solutions, microorganisms as individual phases, etc.), without loss in the handling of simple problems. These two classes are overlaid by CHEPROO, a general structure designed for interaction with other codes. CHEPROO can be used as a geochemical tool for the modeling of complex processes such as biodegradation or evaporation at high salinities. However, many functions CHEPROO are devoted to coupling a broad range of chemical processes to other phenomena (flow, transport, mechanical). We have shown that reactive transport (based on either DSA or SIA approaches) could be easily implemented into existing conservative transport code with a minimal number of changes. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The chemical species of the system are represented by all-atom potentials with interaction parameters taken from the literature. The accuracy of the molecular model is validated by comparing simulation results with experimental data. We also compare the simulation results with a macroscopic thermodynamic model based on the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state. The simulation results for the reaction conversion show very good agreement with available experimental data over a wide range of temperatures and pressures, whereas the corresponding results from the macroscopic thermodynamic model slightly deteriorate with increasing pressure. Based on these comparisons, the predicted values of the reaction temperature and composition of the exit stream from the simulations are more accurate than the corresponding predicted values from the macroscopic thermodynamic model. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {The initial motion of two-dimensional capsule in microchannel flow just after release is investigated in this paper by a numerical simulation method, which combines the finite volume method with the front tracking technique. The capsule is modeled as liquid medium enclosed by a thin membrane, for which linear elastic properties are taken into consideration. Three kinds of initial capsule shapes (circle, ellipse, and biconcave) and three initial positions (center-line, near-center, and near-wall positions) are considered in the simulations. Off-center capsules (the near-center and near-wall capsules) experience tilting and membrane tank-treading, and migrate laterally while they move with the fluid flow. After initial rapid tilting, the circular and elliptic near-wall capsules reach quasistationary tilt orientation, while the biconcave near-wall capsules experience steady change in tilt orientation with time. Lateral movements of the capsules indicate the existence of lift effect causing the capsule to move away from the wall. Lift velocities, the velocity components along the transverse direction, of the circular near-wall capsules decrease as they approach the centerline, while those of the elliptic and biconcave near-wall capsules do not show this trend, which might result from the short range of the simulation time. In general, the capsule with higher membrane dilation modulus has lower lift velocity, showing the effect of capsule deformability on the capsule behavior. Both tank-treading and lift velocities are 1-2 orders lower than the capsule translational velocity. For the circular and biconcave capsules, no matter the center-line or off-center capsules, hematocrit ratio increases with the membrane dilation modulus, namely, the capsule moving velocity decreases with the increasing dilation modulus, while the elliptic capsules with nondimensional membrane dilation moduli of 2500 and 500 show inverse trend in some time range. A preliminary study is carried out for long-term simulation of a circular capsule.},

In particular, we develop a novel Bayesian optimization algorithm, the derivative-enabled knowledge-gradient (dKG), for which we show one-step Bayes-optimality, asymptotic consistency, and greater one-step value of information than is possible in the derivative-free setting. Our procedure accommodates noisy and incomplete derivative information, and comes in both sequential and batch forms. We show dKG provides state-of-the-art performance compared to a wide range of optimization procedures with and without gradients, on benchmarks including logistic regression, kernel learning, and k-nearest neighbors.},

  abstract     = {A compositional formulation is a reliable option for understanding the complex subsurface processes and the associated physical changes. However, this type of model has a great computational cost, since the number of equations that needs to be solved in each grid block increases proportionally with the number of components employed, thereby making them computationally demanding. In an effort to enhance the solution strategy of the hyperbolic problem, we herewith propose a multiscale reconstruction of compositional transport problem. Until recently, multiscale techniques have been seldom implemented on transport equations. Here, the ideology consists of two stages, wherein two different sets of restriction and prolongation operators are defined based on the dynamics of compositional transport. In the first stage, an operator restricting the arbitrary number of components to single transport equation is implemented with the objective of reconstructing the leading and trailing shock positions in space. The prediction of front propagation is the most critical aspect of the approach, as they involve a lot of uncertainty. Once their positions are identified, the full solution lying in the regions outside the shocks can be conservatively reconstructed based on the prolongation interpolation operator. Subsequently, the solution for the multicomponent problem (full system) in the two-phase region is reconstructed by solving just two transport equations with the aid of restriction operator defined based on an invariant thermodynamic path (based on Compositional Space Parameterization technique). We demonstrate applicability of the approach for the idealistic 1D test cases involving various gas drives with different number of components. Further, the first stage reconstruction was tested successfully on more realistic problems based on implementation in recently developed Operator-Based Linearization (OBL) platform.},

A thermodynamic speciation model coupled to electrochemical kinetic model is used to calculate the uniform corrosion rates in a variety of mixed acid systems. Such a model can also compute the corrosion potential; an important parameter that can determine the occurrence of a variety of localized corrosion processes. For systems undergoing localized corrosion, a semi-empirical model, involving repassivation and corrosion potentials is described, Other approaches to corrosion prediction are described briefly. Areas for further development are identified.},

This additional information aims to avoid considering phases that may not be "active" under current environmental conditions. The database is especially devoted to environmental applications, ranging from waste material management to pollutant behaviour, including the context of deep underground disposal. Selection rules and conventions are illustrated through the example of the Fe-water system, while a second example details the relationships between low and high ionic strength media, from the point of view of thermodynamic databases.

The solubility of NaCl and CO2 in pure water and the solubility of CO2 in NaCl and Na2SO4 solutions have also been correlated. The results show that the Extended UNIQUAC model, with the added pressure parameters, is able to represent binary (NaCl-H2O, CaCO3-H2O, BaCO3-H2O, SrCO3-H2O, MgCO3-H2O, Mg(OH)2-H2O and CO2-H2O), ternary (CaCO3-CO2-H2O, BaCO3-CO2-H2O, SrCO3-CO2-H2O, MgCO3-CO2-H2O, CO2-NaCl-H2O and CO2-Na2SO4-H2O), and quaternary (CO2-NaCl-Na2SO4-H2O) solubility data within the experimental accuracy in the range of temperatures and pressures considered in the study, i.e. from 0 to 250 ??C, and from 1 to 1000 bar, respectively.

In natural environments, many chemical reactions occur, both at the interface between rocks and fluids (e.g., dissolution reactions) and in bulk phases (e.g., aqueous speciation). Moreover, the typical ionic species found in nature require thermodynamic models for electrolytes, increasing the calculation complexity. In this work, we present RAND-based algorithms, which originate from Gibbs energy minimization, for geochemical CPE problems for closed systems and open systems. The open system problems specify fixed chemical potentials for non-charged species, as in a constant partial CO2 pressure problem, or for charged ionic species, as in a constant pH problem. We showcase the robustness and efficiency of these algorithms using the mineral system Mg-Si-Ca-CO2-H2O because of its relevance to CO2 underground geological storage. The algorithms show quadratic convergence and the coupled tangent plane distance analysis can determine the most stable phase assemblage. The algorithms generate results in agreement with PHREEQC, whereas they are much faster than PHREEQC. The described algorithms can be potentially used for reliable and fast simulation of CO2 storage in geological formations, and of other processes in natural environments involving geochemical equilibrium.},

The coupled code is highly parallelized using an overlapping domain decomposition approach in combination with execution of multiple threads that solve chemical equilibria in parallel. FE reactive transport schemes are often affected by spurious concentration oscillations. We effectively suppress these oscillations with a linearized algebraic flux corrected transport (FCT) algorithm. An application example is presented which investigates the evolution of material interfaces in a deep geological repository for nuclear waste. The example uses all features of the new coupled code: flow and multi-component transport in variably saturated media, and a very complex chemical setup which makes extensive use of (non-linear) solid solution formulations for mineral phases. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract     = {A comprehensive model has been developed for calculating the viscosity of aqueous or mixed-solvent electrolyte systems ranging from dilute solutions to fused salts. The model incorporates a mixing rule for calculating the viscosity of solvent mixtures and a method for predicting the effect of finite electrolyte concentrations. The mixing rule represents the viscosity of multi-component solvent mixtures using molar volumes and viscosities of pure components together with binary parameters. With this mixing rule, the viscosity of ternary systems can be accurately predicted using parameters determined from only binary data. The effect of electrolyte concentration on viscosity is modeled by combining a long-range electrostatic term obtained from the Onsager-Fuoss theory, a contribution of individual ions, which is quantified by the Jones-Dole B coefficients, and a contribution of specific interactions between ions or neutral species. Formulations have been developed for the contributions of individual ions and species-species interactions to account for the effect of multiple solvents. In addition to solvent composition, the species-species interaction term is also a function of ionic strength. The model accurately reproduces the viscosity of systems such as salts in water, organic or mixed water-organic solvents and aqueous acids or bases up to the pure solute limit. The model has been coupled with thermodynamic equilibrium calculations to reproduce the effects of complexation or other ionic reactions on viscosity. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {The conventional Gibbs energy minimization methods apply elemental amounts of system components as conservation constraints in the form of a stoichiometric conservation matrix. The linear constraints designate the limitations set on the components described by the system constituents. The equilibrium chemical potentials of the constituents are obtained as a linear combination of the component-specific contributions, which are solved with the Lagrange method of undetermined multipliers. When the Gibbs energy of a multiphase system is also affected by conditions due to immaterial properties, the constraints must be adjusted by the respective entities. The constrained free energy (CFE) minimization method includes such conditions and incorporates every immaterial constraint accompanied with its conjugate potential. The respective work or affinity-related condition is introduced to the Gibbs energy calculation as an additional Lagrange multiplier. Thus, the minimization procedure can include systemic or external potential variables with their conjugate coefficients as well as non-equilibrium affinities. Their implementation extends the scope of Gibbs energy calculations to a number of new fields, including surface and interface systems, multi - phase fiber suspensions with Donnan partitioning, kinetically controlled partial equilibria, and pathway analysis of reaction networks.},

The modified Kent-Eisenberg model was used to determine the deprotonation constant and carbamate stability constant for MEA, DEA, and AMP solutions at different temperatures. The solubility of CO2 in aqueous mixtures of AMP with MEA or DEA has been predicted using the modified Kent-Eisenberg model and reaction equilibrium constants, which were determined from each amine. The predicted values were in good agreement with the experimental data over a wide range of equilibrium CO2 partial pressure, temperature, and solution concentration. The concentration of the liquid-phase species was calculated as a function of CO2 loading, and some qualitative trends were obtained.},

  abstract     = {A chemical or biochemical reaction can drive an ion through a semipermeable membrane and set up an electric potential difference that can cause the transport of a different ion through the membrane against its concentration gradient. This article treats the thermodynamics of a system in which an ionic reaction A + B = C drives C through a membrane permeable only to C:. The fundamental equation for the Gibbs energy G leads to a criterion for spontaneous change and equilibrium involving the transferred charge Q as a natural variable. This leads to an extension of the membrane equilibrium equation. It is shown that the number D of natural variables is equal to the number f of independent intensive variables (degrees of freedom) plus the number of phases. Since the charge transferred is not a convenient natural variable from an experimental point of view, a Legendre transform is used to define a transformed Gibbs energy G' that has the potential difference between the phases as a natural variable. This leads to the transformed chemical potential mu(i)' that is related to the chemical potential by mu(i) = mu(i)' + Fz phi(i). Since the chemical potential, which has the same value in phases at equilibrium, is given by mu(i) = mu(i) degrees + RT In a(i)+ Fz phi(i), the transformed chemical potential for i in a multiphase system with potential differences is given by mu(i)' = mu i degrees + RT In a(i).},

Also, it has been applied to calculate phase equilibria and speciation in strongly associating systems such as sulfuric acid/oleum (H2SO 4+SO3+H2O) in the entire concentration range. The model combines an excess Gibbs energy model with detailed speciation calculations. The excess Gibbs energy model consists of a long-range interaction contribution represented by the Pitzer-Debye-H{\"{u}}ckel expression, a short-range term expressed by the UNIQUAC model and a middle-range term of a second-virial-coefficient type for specific ionic interactions. The model accurately represents the thermodynamic behavior of systems ranging from infinite dilution in water to pure acids and beyond, e.g. in mixtures of H 2SO4 and SO3. In particular, the model has been shown to predict speciation that is consistent with spectroscopic measurements for the H2SO4+H2O system. In addition, vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid equilibria can be accurately reproduced in mixtures that show complex phase behavior. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

For those situations, an extended Gibbs energy method can be applied.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we provide an alternative, more general theoretical basis for damage function analysis (DFA), by drawing an analogy between the growth of a pit and the movement of a particle. In contrast to our previous formulation of DFA, which was developed specifically for enabling the damage function for localized corrosion to be calculated from the point defect model for passivity breakdown, the coupled environment pitting model for pit growth, and the theory of prompt and delayed repassivation, the new formulation readily incorporates any theories or models (deterministic or empirical) for these stages in the development of a pit. We show that the new formulation leads to the original expressions for the damage functions for active (living) and passivated (dead) pits, and hence for the differential and integral damage functions, as were obtained from the original theory. We also describe the unification of deterministic (damage function analysis, DFA) and empirical, statistical (extreme value statistics, EVS) methods for predicting the development of localized corrosion damage on metal surfaces. In particular, we have devised a means of estimating the central and scale parameters of EVS directly from DFA in a "first principles" manner, as well as from fitting the EVS distribution function to experimental data for short times, in order to predict the extreme value distributions at longer times. The techniques have been evaluated on EVS data for the pitting of manganese steel in CO 2-acidified seawater and for the pitting of aluminum in tap water. Finally, we outline the generalization of pit nucleation, as described by the point defect model, for external conditions that depend on time. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The software was exemplified using a five-component buffer recipe which consists of boric acid, citric acid, ethylenediamine, potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate and trishydroxymethylaminomethane. It has been demonstrated that the proposed buffer solution with the composition calculated by the BUFMAKE program is suitable for use in ultra-violet spectrophotometry over a broad range of pH (2-12), buffer capacity (0.01-0.05) and ionic strength (0.1-0.3).

The method is based on a stoichiometric approach, which uses Newton's method to solve a system of mass-action equations coupled with a system of equilibrium constraints. A stabilisation procedure is developed to promote convergence of the calculation when a presupposed phase in the chemical system is absent in the equilibrium state. The formulation of the chemical equilibrium problem is developed by presuming no specific details of the involved phases and species. As a consequence, the method is flexible and general enough so that the calculation can be customised with a combination of thermodynamic models that are appropriate for the problem of interest. Finally, we show the use of the method to solve relevant geochemical equilibrium problems for modelling carbon storage in highly saline aquifers. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.}

  abstract     = {A comprehensive model has been developed for calculating the interfacial tension ($\sigma$) in liquid-liquid systems with or without electrolyte components. The model consists of an equation for computing the interfacial tension of two-liquid-phase nonelectrolyte systems and an expression for the effect of the electrolyte concentration. The dependence of the interfacial tension on the electrolyte concentration was derived by combining the Gibbs equation with a modified Langmuir adsorption isotherm that represents the interfacial excess of the solute species. The Langmuir adsorption formalism was extended by introducing the effects of binary interactions between solute species (ions or molecules) on the interface. The equation for the interfacial tension of nonelectrolyte liquid-liquid systems was derived using a general thermodynamic framework that was empirically extended by introducing an effective interfacial area that is defined for each component and takes into account the effects of other components at the interface. The model was found to reproduce experimental data for a variety of liquid-liquid systems. In particular, the interfacial tension of ternary systems can be accurately predicted using parameters determined from only binary data. Furthermore, the interfacial tension model was coupled with a previously developed thermodynamic model to provide activity coefficients and equilibrium concentrations in coexisting liquid phases. This makes it possible to reproduce the effects of speciation and salting out or salting in. Because of the coupling of the thermodynamic model with interfacial tension calculations, the variation of $\sigma$ with electrolyte concentration can be reasonably predicted even without introducing electrolyte-specific parameters in the interfacial tension model. Thus, the model can be used to estimate the electrolyte effect on $\sigma$ in the absence of experimental data. With regressed model parameters, the average deviations between the calculated results and experimental data were 0.50 mN{\textperiodcentered}m-1 for 30 binary nonelectrolyte systems, 0.88 mN{\textperiodcentered}m-1 for 23 ternary nonelectrolyte systems, and 0.16 mN{\textperiodcentered}m-1 for 26 systems with ionic components. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

This decrease began sooner in physics, a field that was quicker to make the transition into the electronic domain. Furthermore, since 1990, the proportion of highly cited papers coming from highly cited journals has been decreasing, and accordingly, the proportion of highly cited papers not coming from highly cited journals has also been increasing. Should this pattern continue, it might bring an end to the use of the Impact Factor as a way to evaluate the quality of journals, papers and researchers.},

  abstract     = {The origin of pyroxenites and their relation to melt migration in the mantle have been investigated in two pyroxenite-rich zones in the Beni Bousera massif. Based on combined field, microtextural, mineralogical and geochemical observations, the pyroxenites were separated into four types. Type-I Cr-diopside websterites contain bright green diopside and have primitive bulk Ni, Cr and Mg-number. Their trace element systematics are characterized by slight light rare earth element (LREE) enrichment compared with the middle (MREE) and heavy (H)REE, and negative high field strength element (HFSE) anomalies in bulk-rock and mineral compositions suggesting that they result from melting of metasomatized mantle. Trace element concentrations of melts calculated to be in equilibrium with Type-I cpx have a subduction-like signature and show a close similarity to certain lavas erupted in the Alboran Basin. Calculated mineral equilibration temperatures of [{\~{}}]1200 to 1350{\{}degrees{\}}C are close to the basalt liquidus and higher than for other pyroxenite types in Beni Bousera, which generally yield {\textless}1100{\{}degrees{\}}C. Type-II spinel websterites are also primitive, but contain augitic clinopyroxene; their whole-rock compositions are characterized by high Ti, Ni, and Mg-number, intermediate Cr and trace element patterns with LREE depletion over the MREE and HREE. Type-III garnet pyroxenites, which include the famous diamond-pseudomorph-bearing garnet pyroxenites, are more evolved than Types-I and -II and have low and variable Mg-number correlating with an Fe-enrichment trend. High bulk-rock and garnet HREE to LREE ratios result from high-pressure fractionation of garnet and augitic cpx at calculated pressures of {\textgreater}45 to 20-30 kbar. Type-III pyroxenites display strong variations of LREE and HFSE depletion and strong bulk Nb/Ta fractionation. Calculated melts in equilibrium with augitic cpx are variably enriched in incompatible trace elements similar to intraplate basalts. Type-IV pyroxenites are composed of green diopside, opx, garnet and plagioclase and/or spinel. Whole-rocks have high Na2O, CaO and Al2O3 concentrations and high Mg-number, are HREE depleted, and have positive Eu and Sr anomalies. Garnets are characterized by low HREE/MREE and positive Eu anomalies. The absence of bulk-rock HREE enrichment indicates a metamorphic origin for this garnet, which is corroborated by the presence of Al-rich metamorphic spinels. Relict magmatic plagioclase indicates a shallower ({\textless}10 kbar) crustal origin for these pyroxenites. Their metamorphic assemblage yields temperatures and pressures of 800-980{\{}degrees{\}}C and 14 kbar, indicating a pressure increase during the metamorphic overprint. The whole-rock geochemistry of Type-IV pyroxenites is comparable with that of rocks from the lower crustal section of the Kohistan (northern Pakistan) paleo-arc, indicating a possible origin of these rocks as cumulates in the deeper arc crust and subsequent delamination into the underlying mantle.},

  abstract     = {A new formulation is presented of the static relative permittivity or dielectric constant of water and steam, including supercooled and supercritical states. The range is from 238 K to 873 K, at pressures up to 1200 MPa. The formulation is based on the ITS-90 temperature scale. It correlates a selected set of data from a recently published collection of all experimental data. The set includes new data in the liquid water and the steam regions that have not been part of earlier correlations. The physical basis for the formulation is the so-called g -factor in the form proposed by Harris and Alder. An empirical 12-parameter form for the g -factor as a function of the independent variables temperature and density is used. For the conversion of experimental pressures to densities, the newest formulation of the equation of state of water on the ITS-90, prepared by Wagner and Pruss, has been used. All experimental data are compared with the formulation. The reliability of the new formulation is assessed in all subregions. Comparisons with previous formulations are presented. Auxiliary dielectric-constant formulations as functions of temperature are included for the saturated vapor and liquid states. The pressure and temperature derivatives of the dielectric constant and the Debye–H{\"{u}}ckel limiting-law slopes are calculated, their reliability is estimated, and they are compared with experimentally derived values and with previous correlations. All equations are given in this paper, along with short tables. An implementation of this formulation for the dielectric constant is available on disk [A. H. Harvey, A. P. Peskin, and S. A. Klein, NIST/ASME Steam Properties, NIST Standard Reference Database 10, Version 2.1, Standard Reference Data Program, NIST, Gaithersburg, MD (1997)].},

It has also been used to study the effect of heats of formation and different types of binders on the predicted performance of explosive formulations. It is shown that the CHEETAH 2.0 program using the traditional Chapman-Jouget thermodynamic detonation theory can accurately model and predict performance of new explosive materials and of ideal explosives. It can also predict reasonably accurately experimental results for mildly non-ideal explosives. It is also shown that the CHEETAH 2.0 program based on the Wood-Kirkwood detonation theory can successfully model both mildly non-ideal explosives and moderate non-ideal explosives. It can replicate many of the features of non-ideal explosives such as detonation velocities and sonic reaction zone widths, and explosive properties such as detonation velocities as a function of the charge radius. In attempting to apply CHEETAH 2.0 to PBXW-115(Aust) using the estimated radius of curvature for the detonation front built into the code, difficulties were initially encountered in achieving convergence to a self-propagating detonation velocity. However, if an experimentally determined radius of curvature is used, good results are achieved from "Kinetic" CHEETAH, reflecting non-ideal features such as detonation velocities dependent on charge radius. Finally, in view of the strengths and limitations of CHEETAH, recommendations for the future work are made.},

  abstract     = {In the subsurface, fluids play a critical role by transporting dissolved minerals, colloids, and contaminants (sometimes over long distances); by mediating dissolution and precipitation processes; and by enabling chemical transformations in solution and at mineral surfaces. Although the complex geometries of fracture apertures, fracture networks, and pore spaces may make it difficult to accurately predict fluid flow in saturated (single-phase) subsurface systems, well-developed methods are available. The simulation of multiphase fluid flow in the subsurface is much more challenging because of the large density and/or viscosity ratios found in important applications (water/air in the vadose zone; water/oil, water/gas, gas/oil, and water/oil/gas in hydrocarbon reservoirs; water/air/nonaqueous phase liquids (nonaqueous phase liquids/dense nonaqueous phase liquids) in contaminated vadose zone systems; and gas/molten rock in volcanic systems, for example). In addition, the complex behavior of fluid-fluid-solid contact lines and their impact on dynamic contact angles must also be taken into account and coupled with the fluid flow. Here we review the methods that are currently being used to simulate pore-scale multiphase fluid flow and reactive transport in fractured and porous media. After the introduction, the review begins with an overview of the fundamental physics of multiphase fluids flow followed by a more detailed discussion of the complex dynamic behavior of contact lines and contact angles, an important barrier to accurate pore-scale modeling and simulation. The main part of the review focuses on five different approaches: pore network models, lattice gas and lattice Boltzmann methods, Monte Carlo methods, particle methods (molecular dynamics, dissipative particle dynamics, and smoothed particle hydrodynamics), and traditional grid-based computational fluid dynamics coupled with interface tracking and a contact angle model. Finally, the review closes with a discussion of future trends and challenges.},

An ion-association aqueous model was derived by least-squares fitting of ion-association stability constants and individual-ion, activity-coefficient parameters to experimental mean activity coefficients for various salts at 25 C. Salts of the following cations and anions were considered: Al(+3), Ba(+2) , Ca(+2), Cd(+2), Co(+2), Cs(+), Cu(+2), Fe(+2), H(+), K(+), Li( +), Mg(+2), Mn(+2), Na(+), Ni(+2), Pb(+2), Sr(+2), Zn(+2), Cl(-) , ClO4(-), F(-), OH(-), and SO4(-2). The stability constants of the derived model and the WATEQ model were in agreement for most two-ion complexes but were not in agreement for most complexes containing three or more ions. The largest discrepancies in stability constants were for complexes Cu(+2), Mn(+2), Ni(+2), and Zn(+2) with Cl(-). The derived-model calculations matched the experimental data for all salts to a concentration of about 2 molal, but the parameters of the model could not be defined uniquely by the fitting process. Alternative choices for the complexes included in the model and for the individual-ion, activity-coefficient parameters could fit the experimental data equally well.

In this research, an unconventional method, called the potentiometric titration, was used to obtain the solubility of CO2 in distilled water and NaCl brine. The solubility data for the low salinity range are scarce in the literature. Thus, in this research, the CO2 solubility was obtained in NaCl brines of low salinity (0-15000 ppm) at temperatures between 60 °C and 100 °C and pressures up to 25 MPa. Moreover, the salting-out effect was estimated using the Setchenov's constant as a measure of reduction in solubility when salt is added to the solution. The solubility points obtained by the potentiometric titration method demonstrated very good consistency with those obtained by the previous methods.},

In the first section, we will focus on hydrothermal synthesis as a materials synthesis technology by providing history, process definitions, technological merits and comments on its current implementation in industry. In the second section, we will describe how thermodynamic modeling is being developed as an engineering tool to predict equilibrium phase assemblages and use this predictive power as an engineering tool for development of hydrothermal technology for materials synthesis.},

Instead, a solution to a trust region subproblem is defined by minimizing a quadratic function subject only to an ellipsoidal constraint. The iterates generated are strictly feasible. Our proposed method reduces to a standard trust region approach for the unconstrained problem when there are no upper or lower bounds on the variables. Global and local quadratic convergence is established. Preliminary numerical experiments are reported indicating the practical viability of this approach.},

  abstract     = {Internal consistency of thermodynamic data has long been considered vital for confident calculations of aqueous geochemical processes. However, an internally consistent mineral thermodynamic data set is not necessarily consistent with calculations of aqueous species thermodynamic properties due, potentially, to improper or inconsistent constraints used in the derivation process. In this study, we attempt to accommodate the need for a mineral thermodynamic data set that is internally consistent with respect to aqueous species thermodynamic properties by adapting the least squares optimization methods of Powell and Holland (1985). This adapted method allows for both the derivation of mineral thermodynamic properties from fluid chemistry measurements of solutions in equilibrium with mineral assemblages, as well as estimates of the uncertainty on the derived results. Using a large number of phase equilibria, solubility, and calorimetric measurements, we have developed a thermodynamic data set of 12 key aluminum-bearing mineral phases. These data are derived to be consistent with Na+ and K+ speciation data presented by Shock and Helgeson (1988), H4SiO4(aq) data presented by Stef{\'{a}}nsson (2001), and the Al speciation data set presented by Tagirov and Schott (2001). Many of the constraining phase equilibrium measurements are exactly the same as those used to develop other thermodynamic data, yet our derived values tend to be quite different than some of the others' due to our choices of reference data. The differing values of mineral thermodynamic properties have implications for calculations of Al mineral solubilities; specifically, kaolinite solubilities calculated with the developed data set are as much as 6.75 times lower and 73{\%} greater than those calculated with Helgeson et al. (1978) and Holland and Powell (2011) data, respectively. Where possible, calculations and experimental data are compared at low T, and the disagreement between the two sources reiterates the common assertion that low-T measurements of phase equilibria and mineral solubilities in the aluminum system rarely represent equilibrium between water and well-crystallized, aluminum-bearing minerals. As an ancillary benefit of the derived data, we show that it may be combined with high precision measurements of aqueous complex association constants to derive neutral species activity coefficients in supercritical fluids. Although this contribution is specific to the aluminum system, the methods and concepts developed here can help to improve the calculation of water-rock interactions in a broad range of earth systems. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

On the contrary, if a temperature-independent volume translation parameter is used, most of the 1-phase and 2-phase properties are preserved. In the present study, the influence of the incorporation of a volume translation in an equation of state, on mixture properties (essentially phase equilibria and properties of mixing) is addressed. It is first assumed that the volume-translation parameter of a mixture (c) is related to mole fractions through a quadratic mixing rule involving mutual volume translation parameters (cij). It is found that only a simple arithmetic-mean combining rule for cij makes it possible to preserve phase equilibria. Using such a combining rule entails that the quadratic mixing rule for the c parameter degenerates to a linear mixing rule. Secondly, it is then proved that properties of mixing (gM, hM, sM, cPM {\ldots}) are preserved if a linear mixing rule is used for the c parameter and altered otherwise.},

In this paper, it is shown that the CSP method simultaneously approximates the tangent spaces to the fast fibers along which solutions relax to the slow manifold. Again, each iteration adds one order of accuracy. In some studies, the output of the CSP algorithm is postprocessed by linearly projecting initial data onto the slow manifold along these approximate tangent spaces. These projections, in turn, also become successively more accurate.},

  abstract     = {A model has been developed for predicting the localized corrosion repassivation potential (Erp) for alloys in environments containing chloride ions and hydrogen sulfide. The model has been combined with Erp measurements for a 13-Cr supermartensitic stainless steel (UNS S41425) at various concentrations of Cl- and H2S. The model accounts for competitive adsorption at the interface between the metal and the occluded site environment, the effect of adsorbed species on anodic dissolution, and the formation of solid phases in the process of repassivation. The effect of H2S is complex, as it may give rise to a strong enhancement of anodic dissolution in the occluded environment and may lead to the formation of solid metal sulfide phases, which compete with the formation of metal oxides. H2S can substantially reduce the repassivation potential, thus indicating a strongly enhanced tendency for localized corrosion and stress corrosion cracking. However, exceptions exist at lower H2S and Cl- concentrations, at which H2S may lead to the inhibition of localized corrosion. The model accurately reproduces the measured repassivation potentials for Alloy S41425 and the limited literature data for Alloy CA6NM (UNS J91574), thus elucidating the conditions at which H2S increases the propensity for localized corrosion and those at which it does not. Because the repassivation potential defines the threshold condition for the existence of stable pits or crevice corrosion, the model provides the foundation for predicting localized corrosion and stress corrosion cracking in environments that are relevant to oil and gas production.},

  abstract     = {A comprehensive model has been developed for calculating the viscosity of aqueous or mixed-solvent electrolyte systems ranging from dilute solutions to fused salts. The model incorporates a mixing rule for calculating the viscosity of solvent mixtures and a method for predicting the effect of finite electrolyte concentrations. The mixing rule represents the viscosity of multi-component solvent mixtures using molar volumes and viscosities of pure components together with binary parameters. With this mixing rule, the viscosity of ternary systems can be accurately predicted using parameters determined from only binary data. The effect of electrolyte concentration on viscosity is modeled by combining a long-range electrostatic term obtained from the Onsager-Fuoss theory, a contribution of individual ions, which is quantified by the Jones-Dole B coefficients, and a contribution of specific interactions between ions or neutral species. Formulations have been developed for the contributions of individual ions and species-species interactions to account for the effect of multiple solvents. In addition to solvent composition, the species-species interaction term is also a function of ionic strength. The model accurately reproduces the viscosity of systems such as salts in water, organic or mixed water-organic solvents and aqueous acids or bases up to the pure solute limit. The model has been coupled with thermodynamic equilibrium calculations to reproduce the effects of complexation or other ionic reactions on viscosity. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

It avoids the difficulties associated with indefinite quadratic programming subproblems by defining this subproblem to be always convex. The novel feature of the approach is the addition of an equality constrained quadratic programming (EQP) phase that promotes fast convergence and improves performance in the presence of ill conditioning. This EQP phase uses exact second-order information and can be implemented using either a direct solve or an iterative method. The paper studies the global and local convergence properties of the new algorithm and presents a set of numerical experiments to illustrate its practical performance.},

We use X-ray microtomography to investigate dynamic pore structure evolution in situ at temperatures and pressures representative of underground reservoirs and aquifers. A 4 mm diameter Ketton carbonate core is injected with CO2-saturated brine at 50 °C and 10 MPa while tomographic images are taken at 15 min intervals with a 3.8 {\$}\mu{\$}m spatial resolution over a period of 2(1/2) h. An approximate doubling of porosity with only a 3.6{\%} increase in surface area to volume ratio is measured from the images. Pore-scale direct simulation and network modeling on the images quantify an order of magnitude increase in permeability and an appreciable alteration of the velocity field. We study the uniform reaction regime, with dissolution throughout the core. However, at the pore scale, we see variations in the degree of dissolution with an overall reaction rate which is approximately 14 times lower than estimated from batch measurements. This work implies that in heterogeneous rocks, pore-scale transport of reactants limits dissolution and can reduce the average effective reaction rate by an order of magnitude.},

  abstract     = {To address the need to predict the properties of fluids in severe environments in the oil and gas industry, a comprehensive thermodynamic model has been developed for mixtures containing hydrogen sulfide (H2S), carbon dioxide (CO2), H2O, and selected salts. The model is based on the previously developed mixedsolvent electrolyte framework, which combines an equation of state for standard-state properties of individual species, an excess-Gibbs-energy model, and an algorithm for solving phase and chemical equilibria in multiphase systems. The standard-state properties are calculated from the Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers (Helgeson et al. 1974a, 1974b, 1976, 1981; Tanger and Helgeson 1988) equation, whereas the excess Gibbs energy is expressed as a sum of a long-range electrostatic-interaction term expressed by a Pitzer-Debye-H{\"{u}}ckel equation (Pitzer 1980), a virial coefficienttype term for interactions between ions, and a short-range term for interactions involving neutral molecules. The model has been parameterized using critically evaluated phase equilibrium data for various binary and ternary subsystems of the H2S/CO2/H2O/Na/Ca/Cl system and has been validated for temperatures ranging from 0 to 300°C, pressures up to approximately 3,500 atm, and salt concentrations up to solid saturation. The model reproduces chemical speciation in acid gas/brine systems as exemplified by the accurate prediction of pH. Because of its capability of predicting pH and activities of solution species, the model can serve as a foundation for studying metal/environment interactions in severe oil and gas environments.},

  abstract     = {The stoichiometric relations in a series of biochemical reactions are summarized by a stoichiometric number matrix (with a column for each reaction) and a conservation matrix (with a row for each constraint). These two matrices for a series or cycle of biochemical reactions are related because the columns of the stoichiometric number matrix are in the null space of the conservation matrix, and the rows of the transpose of the conservation matrix are in the null space of the transpose of the stoichiometric number matrix. The conservation matrix for a system of biochemical reactions is of interest because it shows the nature of the constraints in addition to the conservation of atoms and groups. Constraints beyond those for the conservation of atoms and groups indicate "missing reactions" that do not occur because the enzymes involved couple reactions that could occur and still conserve atoms and groups. The interpretation of conservation matrices and stoichiometric matrices for a reaction system is complicated by the fact that they are not unique. However, their row-reduced forms are unique, as are their dimensions, which represent the number of reactants and number of independent reactions. Two matrices that look different contain the same information if they have the same row-reduced form. The urea cycle, which involves five enzyme-catalyzed reactions, and its net reaction are discussed in terms of the linear constraints produced by enzyme catalysis. A procedure to obtain a set of conservation equations that will yield the correct net reaction is described.},

  abstract     = {An extensive computer program called ChemSage, based upon the SOLGASMIX Gibbs energy minimizer, is presented together with several examples which illustrate its use. ChemSage was designed to perform three types of thermochemical calculations in complex systems involving phases exhibiting nonideal mixing properties. These are the calculation of thermodynamic functions, heterogeneous phase equilibria, and steady-state conditions for the simulation of simple multistage reactors. The thermodynamic functions module calculates specific heat, enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs energy with respect to a chosen reference state for a given phase and, if this phase is a mixture, the partial properties of its components. Chemical equilibrium calculations can be made for a system which has been uniquely defined with respect to temperature, pressure (or volume), and composition. One of these quantities may also be replaced by an extensive property or phase target,e.g., for the calculation of adiabatic and liquidus temperatures, respectively.},

The numerical method is developed for efficient modelling of multiphase flow in porous media with complex interface motion and irregular solid boundaries. The Navier-Stokes equations are discretised using a finite volume approach, while the volume-of-fluid method is used to capture the location of interfaces. Capillary forces are computed using a semi-sharp surface force model, in which the transition area for capillary pressure is effectively limited to one grid block. This new formulation along with two new filtering methods, developed for correcting capillary forces, permits simulations at very low capillary numbers and avoids non-physical velocities. Capillary forces are implemented using a semi-implicit formulation, which allows larger time step sizes at low capillary numbers. We verify the accuracy and stability of the numerical method on several test cases, which indicate the potential of the method to predict multiphase flow processes. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.}

A lot of thermodynamic models do not incorporate electrolyte solutions. For these systems special models have been published. However a lot of these models suffer from the fact that highly concentrated electrolyte solutions cannot be calculated with the desired accuracy which leads to problems when calculating, e.g. salt solubilities. In this article, a revised LIQUAC and LIFAC model is presented, which enables the user to describe mean activity coefficients, osmotic coefficients and also vapor-liquid equilibria reliably. Furthermore the prediction of salt solubilities in aqueous solutions and mixed solvents can be performed successfully. In this paper the predicted data are compared with published data stored in the Dortmund Data Bank. The improvements achieved are additionally shown by a comparison with the results of the original LIQUAC and LIFAC model. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The solution of the system of linear equations is a vector of the stoichiometric numbers of the reactions in the pathway for the net reaction; this is referred to as the pathway vector. The pathway vector gives the number of times the various reactions have to occur to produce the desired net reaction. Net reactions may involve unknown numbers of ATP, ADP, and Pi molecules. The numbers of ATP, ADP, and Pi in a desired net reaction can be calculated in a two-step process. In the first step, the pathway is calculated by solving the system of linear equations for an abbreviated stoichiometric number matrix without ATP, ADP, Pi, NADred, and NADox. In the second step, the stoichiometric numbers in the desired net reaction, which includes ATP, ADP, Pi, NADred, and NADox, are obtained by multiplying the full stoichiometric number matrix by the calculated pathway vector.},

A set-theory system of notation is introduced for physicochemical models. Analytical expressions are provided for the chemical potentials of dependent components in symmetric and asymmetric reference states. Necessary and sufficient conditions are formulated for complete and metastable equilibrium using the Kuhn--Tucker conditions of the problem of convex programming, when one- and/or two-sided constraints can be set on part or all sought-for values of mole quantities of dependent components. The prime solution values of the convex programming problem are sought-for values of the molar quantities of dependent components, while the dual solution values are sought- for values of the chemical potentials of independent components of the system related to stoichiometric units. The use of the chemical potentials of independent components allows solving the problem of the determination of the Gibbs free energy of formation of compounds from their known contents in the systems and, vise versa, the concentrations of dependent components in solution phases from the known Gibbs free energies of formation and chemical potentials of independent components in representative subsystems. Dual solutions related to a balance constraint on the electric charge of the system permit explicit calculation of the redox potential of the system, Eh (pe), without considering the partial pressure of oxygen or hydrogen and pH.},

  abstract     = {Selecting the proper primary variables is a critical step in efficiently modeling the highly nonlinear problem of multiphase subsurface flow in a heterogeneous porous-fractured media. Current simulation and ground modeling techniques consist of (1) spatial discretization of mass and/or heat conservation equations using finite difference or finite element methods; (2) fully implicit time discretization; (3) solving the nonlinear, discrete algebraic equations using a Newton iterative scheme. Previous modeling efforts indicate that the choice of primary variables for a Newton iteration not only impacts computational performance of a numerical code, but may also determine the feasibility of a numerical modeling study in many field applications. This paper presents an analysis and general recommendations for selecting primary variables in simulating multiphase, subsurface flow for one-active phase (Richards' equation), two-phase (gas and liquid) and three-phase (gas, water and nonaqueous phase liquid or NAPL) conditions. In many cases, a dynamic variable switching or variable substitution scheme may have to be used in order to achieve optimal numerical performance and robustness. The selection of primary variables depends in general on the sensitivity of the system of equations to the variables selected at given phase and flow conditions. We will present a series of numerical tests and large-scale field simulation examples, including modeling one (active)-phase, two-phase and three-phase flow problems in multi-dimensional, porous-fractured subsurface systems.

  abstract     = {Fundamental determinations of the physical properties of seawater have previously been made for Atlantic surface waters, referred to as “Standard Seawater”. In this paper a Reference Composition consisting of the major components of Atlantic surface seawater is determined using these earlier analytical measurements. The stoichiometry of sea salt introduced here is thus based on the most accurate prior determination of the composition, adjusted to achieve charge balance and making use of the 2005 atomic weights. Reference Seawater is defined as any seawater that has the Reference Composition and a new Reference-Composition Salinity SR is defined to provide the best available estimate of the Absolute Salinity of both Reference Seawater and the Standard Seawater that was used in the measurements of the physical properties. From a practical point of view, the value of SR can be related to the Practical Salinity S by SR=(35.16504/35)gkg-1×S. Reference Seawater that has been “normalized” to a Practical Salinity of 35 has a Reference-Composition Salinity of exactly SR=35.16504gkg−1. The new independent salinity variable SR is intended to be used as the concentration variable for future thermodynamic functions of seawater, as an SI-based extension of Practical Salinity, as a reference for natural seawater composition anomalies, as the currently best estimate for Absolute Salinity of IAPSO Standard Seawater, and as a theoretical model for the electrolyte mixture “seawater”.},

  abstract     = {CO2 injection in oil reservoirs has the dual benefit of sequestration as well as enhancing oil recovery. Accordingly, efforts are underway to inject CO2 in carbonate reservoirs in the Middle East. The CO2 injected in carbonate reservoirs can react with ions present in the brine and the solid calcite in the carbonate rocks. These geochemical reactions impact the overall mole numbers and in some extreme cases, even the number of phases at equilibrium, thereby changing oil recovery predictions using compositional simulations. Hence, it is important to model and quantify the impact of geochemical reactions on the phase behavior of real oil samples. In this research, Gibbs free energy function is used to integrate phase behavior computations and geochemical reactions. The Gibbs free energy minimization method using an elemental balance constraint is used to obtain equilibrium compositions arising out of phase and chemical equilibrium. All reactions are assumed to be at equilibrium. The changes in the phase behavior of real oil samples during CO2 injection due to geochemical reactions are presented. The new phase behavior of real oil samples is used as input in compositional simulations to compare how oil recovery predictions are impacted. A Gibbs free energy framework for integration of phase equilibrium calculations as well as geochemical reactions has been developed. This approach is adaptable to different reservoir brines as well as hydrocarbons. The presented approach helps quantify the impact of geochemical reactions on the phase behavior of real oil samples. It also helps determine apriori, if geochemical reactions should even be considered during CO2 injection in reservoirs.},

The thermodynamic framework is based on a previously developed model for mixed-solvent electrolyte solutions. The framework has been designed to reproduce the properties of salt solutions at temperatures ranging from the freezing point to 300∈°C and concentrations ranging from infinite dilution to the fused salt limit. The model has been parameterized using a combination of an extensive literature database and new isopiestic measurements for thirteen salt mixtures at 140∈°C. The measurements have been performed using Oak Ridge National Laboratory's (ORNL) previously designed gravimetric isopiestic apparatus, which can also detect solid phase precipitation. In addition to various Na-K-Mg-Ca-Cl-NO 3 systems, results are reported for LiCl solutions. Water activities are reported for mixtures with a fixed ratio of salts as a function of the total apparent salt mole fraction. The isopiestic measurements reported here simultaneously reflect two fundamental properties of the system, i.e., the activity of water as a function of solution concentration and the occurrence of solid-liquid transitions. The thermodynamic model accurately reproduces the new isopiestic data as well as literature data for binary, ternary and higher-order subsystems. Because of its high accuracy in calculating vapor-liquid and solid-liquid equilibria, the model is suitable for studying deliquescence behavior of multicomponent salt systems. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.},

  abstract     = {The transport and reaction of fluids in porous media results in unique pore growth and channel evolution as the media are dissolved. This often leads to the formation of highly conductive flow channels, commonly referred to as wormholes. The objective of this work is to predict the influence of transport and reaction on the structure of the wormhole channels. An experimental and theoretical investigation of a variety of fluid systems, including strong acids, weak acids, and chelating agents, provides a wide range of conditions for studying wormhole formation. A generalized description of the dissolution phenomenon is introduced, and a common dependence on the Damk{\"{o}}hler number is demonstrated. The Damk{\"{o}}hler number is shown to dictate the type of wormhole structure formed by systems with various degrees of transport and reaction limitations. An optimum Damk{\"{o}}hler number for channel formation is observed at a value of approximately 0.29 for all of the fluid systems investigated. The stochastic nature of the dissolution phenomenon is described using network models. Results from a 2-D network model and a 3-D physically representative network model agree qualitatively with experimental results and substantiate the existence of an optimum Damk{\"{o}}hler number.}

  abstract     = {The knowledge of phase and chemical equilibrium is clearly important in the analysis and design of a wide variety of chemical processes. These problems are described mathematically by complex systems due to the nonlinear nature of the thermodynamic models. This equilibrium state is characterized by the minimization of the Gibbs free energy. Usually, this problem is calculated by using the method of Lagrange multipliers together with the mass balance conditions as necessary subsidiary conditions. However, the convergence is highly dependent of initial estimates of the Lagrange multipliers. The development of robust and efficient methods for the computation of thermodynamic multi-phase systems has long been a challenge in both chemical engineering and materials science. In this context, both heuristic methods, Genetic Algorithms and Differential Evolution, are able to escape from local minima and saddle points. As main disadvantage the high number of objective function evaluations as compared with classic methods can be mentioned. To overcome this disadvantage, this work proposes the dynamic updating of the population size to reduce the number of objective function evaluations. The methodology is applied to determine phase compositions at the chemical equilibrium of real systems. The results demonstrated that the methodology used represents a promising alternative for the problem studied.},

Microstructural changes with heat treatment were analyzed with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) for thermally treated S32205. The results of the tests indicate that exposure of S32205 to these temperatures resulted in an initial drop in the crevice repassivation potential (Ererev). This drop was partially recovered for specimens aged at 870°Cfor times longer than 5 h, but the recovery was not observed for the 700°C aged material. The drop in Ererev correlated with the precipitation and growth of Cr-depleted secondary austenite as well as a grain boundary chromium-depleted (GBCD) layer between a Cr-rich precipitate and the decomposing ferrite matrix. The depletion severity of the secondary austenite phase differed for S32205 aged at 700°C and 870°C, with the 700°C aged materials yielding a secondary austenite phase containing approximately 12.5{\%} Cr and the 870°C precipitated secondary austenite containing approximately 15.8{\%} Cr. The formation of secondary austenite results in a non-recoverable loss of localized corrosion resistance for S32205. {\textcopyright} 2009, NACE International.},

T ??? 110 ??C; P ??? 600 bar; salinity up to full halite saturation). Flow processes can be modeled isothermally or non-isothermally, and phase conditions represented may include a single (aqueous or CO2-rich) phase, as well as two-phase mixtures. Fluid phases may appear or disappear in the course of a simulation, and solid salt may precipitate or dissolve. ECO2N can model super- as well as sub-critical conditions, but it does not make a distinction between liquid and gaseous CO2 and hence is not applicable for processes that involve two CO2-rich phases.

The total Gibbs free energy of the system is approximated as a quadratic function of the compositions of the gas phase and stable condensed phases, in an orthogonal basis set of pure elements. Only changes in thermal energy and energy related to pressure-volume work are considered. The total Gibbs energy is minimized directly by use of both the slope and the curvature of the Gibbs energy surface with respect to the gas and condensed phase compositions in the basis elements.

Combined with correlations among parameters in the revised Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers (HKF) equation of state (Shock et al., 1992), these estimates permit predictions of standard partial molal volumes, heat capacities, and entropies, as well as apparent standard partial molal enthalpies and Gibbs free energies of formation to 1000 degrees C and 5 kb for hundreds of inorganic aqueous species of interest in geochemistry. Data and parameters for more than 300 inorganic aqueous species are presented. Close agreement between calculated and experimentally determined equilibrium constants for acid dissociation reactions and cation hydrolysis reactions supports the generality and validity of these predictive methods.

A Gibbs free energy model is proposed that unifies different phase descriptions – the Peng–Robinson Equation of State (PR EOS) description for hydrocarbon phase components, the Pitzer activity coefficient model for aqueous components and an ideal solid phase. In particular, we illustrate the use of this model to determine the impact of geochemical reactions, introduced by the presence of an aqueous phase with ions and a solid calcite phase, on the phase envelope of CO2-nC14H30 mixture with different phase descriptions. The presented Gibbs free energy model is adaptable to different reservoir brines and can be used to assess the maximum impact of geochemical reactions during CO2 injection in different hydrocarbon reservoirs.},

These problems have received significant attention from the mathematical programming community. Only limited work exists on bilevel problems using evolutionary computation techniques; however, recently there has been an increasing interest due to the proliferation of practical applications and the potential of evolutionary algorithms in tackling these problems. This paper provides a comprehensive review on bilevel optimization from the basic principles to solution strategies; both classical and evolutionary. A number of potential application problems are also discussed. To offer the readers insights on the prominent developments in the field of bilevel optimization, we have performed an automated text-analysis of an extended list of papers published on bilevel optimization to date. This paper should motivate evolutionary computation researchers to pay more attention to this practical yet challenging area.},

The method requires the solution of N tridiagonal matrix equations per time-step and combines computational simplicity with the possibility of unconditional stability for any N. The regimes of conditional stability for N ??? 6 show that the scheme is less effective for higher dimensional problems, owing to the proliferation of mixed derivatives. An alternative scheme (requiring 2 N tridiagonal operations) which involves a single iteration to time-centre the mixed derivatives is shown to improve accuracy and stability. In particular the iterative scheme allows second-order accuracy and unconditional stability in the important special cases of two and three space dimensions. ?? 1988.},

Several techniques have been developed, particularly those which apply the Gibbs free energy minimization. In addition to calculation of global equilibrium problems, practical process simulation would benefit from algorithms, where reaction rates could be taken into account. In the present work, the method of Lagrange multipliers has been used to incorporate such additional constraints to the minimization problem, which allow a mechanistic reaction rate model to be included in the Gibbsian multi-component calculation. The method can be used to calculate the thermodynamic properties of a multiphase system during a chemical change. The applications include computational materials science, industrial process modeling with known reaction rates combined with complex heat and mass transfer effects and studies of other nonequilibrium systems. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

  abstract     = {Compositional simulation is necessary for the modeling of complex EOR processes. For accurate simulation of compositional processes, we need to couple solution of nonlinear conservation laws for multicomponent multiphase flow and transport, with a system of equations describing the phase behavior of the mixture at q thermodynamic equilibrium. The complexity of the problem requires extensive computations and consumes significant CPU time. We present an efficient and robust framework for the computation of the thermodynamic phase behavior associated with multi-component multiphase flow in porous media. The method is based on adaptive interpolation of supporting tie-lines in compositional space. For the parameterization of full solution of a complex compositional problem we need only a limited number of supporting tie-lines in compositional space. We use a special approach for the adaptive construction of these tie-lines, depending on predefined precision. The parameterized tie-lines are triangulated using Delaunay tessellation, and natural-neighbor interpolation technique is used inside the supporting simplex. The computation of phase behavior for the composition simulation then becomes an iteration-free procedure and does not require any EoS computations. Based on this method, we developed a new nonlinear formulation for fully-implicit compositional simulation for both immiscible and miscible displacement. The treatment of nonlinearities, associated with complex thermodynamic behavior of the fluid, is based on the new set of unknowns - tie-line parameters, which allows for efficient representation of the subcritical region. For the supercritical region we use the standard compositional set of variables that based on the overall composition. A new criterion is proposed for the identification of changes between sub- and super-critical regions, and the robust variable substitution is applied during the simulation process. The efficiency and accuracy of the method is demonstrated for several multi-dimensional compositional problems of practical interest. For the tested problems, the proposed method significantly reduces the computational cost of the thermodynamic calculation compared with the standard EoS-based approach. Moreover, the method shows substantially better nonlinear convergence in the case of near-miscible gas injection simulation. Copyright 2011, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

  abstract     = {Thermohaline convection of subsurface fluids strongly influences heat and mass fluxes within the Earth's crust. The most effective hydrothermal systems develop in the vicinity of magmatic activity and can be important for geothermal energy production and ore formation. As most parts of these systems are inaccessible to direct observations, numerical simulations are necessary to understand and characterize fluid flow. Here, we present a new numerical scheme for thermohaline convection based on the control volume finite element method (CVFEM), allowing for unstructured meshes, the representation of sharp thermal and solute fronts in advection-dominated systems and phase separation of variably miscible, compressible fluids. The model is an implementation of the Complex Systems Modelling Platform CSMP++ and includes an accurate thermodynamic representation of strongly nonlinear fluid properties of salt water for magmatic-hydrothermal conditions (up to 1000°C, 500 MPa and 100 wt{\%} NaCl). The method ensures that all fluid properties are taken as calculated on the respective node using a fully upstream-weighted approach, which greatly increases the stability of the numerical scheme. We compare results from our model with two well-established codes, HYDROTHERM and TOUGH2, by conducting benchmarks of different complexity and find good to excellent agreement in the temporal and spatial evolution of the hydrothermal systems. In a simulation with high-temperature, high-salinity conditions currently outside of the range of both HYDROTHERM and TOUGH2, we show the significance of the formation of a solid halite phase, which introduces heterogeneity. Results suggest that salt added by magmatic degassing is not easily vented or accommodated within the crust and can result in dynamic, complex hydrologies. We present a new numerical scheme for multiphase convection of salt water at magmatic-hydrothermal conditions based on the control volume finite element method. In a series of benchmarks with HYDROTHERM and TOUGH2, we find very good agreement of the simulated hydrothermal systems. Simulations at high-temperature, high-salinity conditions outside of the range of these models show the influence of solid halite on dynamic flow behavior and suggest that salt from magmatic degassing is not easily vented or accommodated within the crust. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

  abstract     = {Carbon sequestration experiments were conducted on uncemented sediment and lithified rock from the Eau Claire Formation, which consisted primarily of K-feldspar and quartz. Cores were heated to accentuate reactivity between fluid and mineral grains and to force CO(2) exsolution. Measured permeability of one sediment core ultimately reduced by 4 orders of magnitude as it was incrementally heated from 21 to 150 °C. Water-rock interaction produced some alteration, yielding sub-$\mu$m clay precipitation on K-feldspar grains in the core's upstream end. Experimental results also revealed abundant newly formed pore space in regions of the core, and in some cases pores that were several times larger than the average grain size of the sediment. These large pores likely formed from elevated localized pressure caused by rapid CO(2) exsolution within the core and/or an accumulating CO(2) phase capable of pushing out surrounding sediment. CO(2) filled the pores and blocked flow pathways. Comparison with a similar experiment using a solid arkose core indicates that CO(2) accumulation and grain reorganization mainly contributed to permeability reduction during the heated sediment core experiment. This suggests that CO(2) injection into sediments may store more CO(2) and cause additional permeability reduction than is possible in lithified rock due to grain reorganization.},

  abstract     = {The Gibbs energy minimization encompasses active use of the chemical potentials (partial molar Gibbs energies) of the constituents of the system. Usually, these appear at their equilibrium values as a result of the minimization calculation, the mass balance constraints being the necessary subsidiary conditions. Yet, there are several such physico-chemical circumstances where the system is also constrained by other factors, such as surface effects, potential fields or even by chemical reaction kinetics. In this paper a particular method is presented by which constrained chemical potentials can be applied in a multi-phase Gibbs energy minimization. The constrained potentials arise typically from work-related thermodynamic displacements in the system. When Gibbs energy minimization is performed by the Lagrange method, these constraints appear as additional Lagrangian multipliers. Examples of the constrained potential method are presented in terms of the electrochemical Donnan equilibria in aqueous systems containing semi-permeable interfaces, the phase formation in surface-energy controlled systems and in systems with affinities controlled by chemical reaction kinetics. The methods have been applied successfully in calculating distribution coefficients for metal ions together with pH-values in pulp suspensions, in the calculation of surface tension of alloys, and in thermochemical process modeling involving chemical reaction rates. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract     = {Application of the quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) in chemical kinetics allows the concentration of some species (QSSA species) to be calculated not only via the solution of kinetic differential equations but also from the concentration of other species using algebraic equations. The difference in the concentrations of QSSA species obtained from the two calculations, at a single time point, is called the instantaneous QSSA error. This error represents a continuous perturbation of the calculated trajectory and causes an overall error in the concentrations of non-QSSA species as well. Two equations are given for the calculation of the instantaneous error. Initial selection of QSSA species can be based on the first equation, which predicts the instantaneous error of a single species. The second more involved error equation takes into account the interaction of errors of selected species and gives the instantaneous error for a group of QSSA species. Successful application of the QSSA requires that the overall error of important species be small. In some cases a small instantaneous error in the QSSA species can be magnified and results in large overall error. Such “pathological” cases can be detected by the calculation of the initial concentration sensitivity matrix. Those species, which induce large overall error, have to be excluded from the group of the QSSA species. The relation of the QSSA to the lifetime of species and to the stiffness of ODES is also discussed. The use of the error formulas is illustrated by the application of the QSSA for a propane pyrolysis mechanism and briefly for the combustion of H2.}

  abstract     = {A model has been developed for evaluating the effect of thermal aging on the repassivation potential of austenitic alloys. The model consists of two parts - a grain boundary microchemistry model for calculating the chromium and molybdenum depletion profiles in the vicinity of grain boundaries and an electrochemical model that relates the repassivation potential to the microchemistry and environmental conditions including temperature and solution chemistry. The grain boundary microchemistry model incorporates a thermodynamic para-equilibrium treatment of the formation of carbides and a kinetic treatment of the diffusion of Cr and Mo. With this model, experimental Cr and Mo depletion profiles can be reproduced for sensitized alloys 600, 825, and 316L. The repassivation potential model accounts for the effects of solution chemistry and temperature by considering competitive dissolution, adsorption and oxide formation processes at the interface between the metal and the occluded site solution. Using a previously established relationship between the repassivation potential and alloy composition, a procedure has been established to calculate the observable repassivation potential by integrating its local values that reflect the alloy microchemistry in the depletion zone. The predicted repassivation potentials agree with experimental data for thermally aged alloys 600 and 825 in chloride solutions. {\textcopyright} 2009 by NACE International.},

  abstract     = {Injection of chemically tuned brines into carbonate reservoirs has been reported to enhance oil recovery by 5–30{\%} original oil in place (OOIP) in coreflooding experiments and field tests. One proposed mechanism for this improved oil recovery (IOR) is wettability alteration of rock from oil-wet or mixed-wet to more-water-wet conditions. Modeling of wettability-alteration experiments, however, are challenging because of the complex interactions among ions in the brine and crude oil on the solid surface. In this research, we developed a multiphase and multicomponent reactive transport model that explicitly takes into account wettability alteration from these geochemical interactions in carbonate reservoirs. Published experimental data suggest that desorption of acidic-oil components from rock surfaces make carbonate rocks more water-wet. One widely accepted mechanism is that sulfate (SO42–) replaces the adsorbed carboxylic group from the rock surface, whereas cations (Ca2+, Mg2+) decrease the oil-surface potential. In the proposed mechanistic model, we used a reaction network that captures the competitive surface reactions among carboxylic groups, cations, and sulfate. These reactions control the wetting fractions and contact angles, which subsequently determine the capillary pressure, relative permeabilities, and residual oil saturations. The developed model was first tuned with experimental data from the Stevns Klint chalk and then used to predict oil recovery for additional untuned experiments under a variety of conditions where IOR increased by as much as 30{\%} OOIP, depending on salinity and oil acidity. The numerical results showed that an increase in sulfate concentration can lead to an IOR of more than 40{\%} OOIP, whereas cations such as Ca2+ have a relatively minor effect on recovery (approximately 5{\%} OOIP). Physical parameters, including the total surface area of the rock and the diffusion coefficients, control the rate of recovery, but not the final oil recovery. The simulation results further demonstrate that the optimum brine formulations for chalk are those with relatively abundant SO42– (0.096 mol/kg water), moderate concentrations of cations, and low salinity (total ionic strength of less than 0.2 mol/kg water). These findings are consistent with the experimental data reported in the literature. The new model provides a powerful tool to predict the IOR potential of chemically tuned waterflooding in carbonate reservoirs under different scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model that explicitly and mechanistically couples multiphase flow and multicomponent surface complexation with wettability alteration and oil recovery for carbonate rocks specifically.},

Unknown thermodynamic properties can be retrieved from experimental Kd values using inverse modelling techniques (Example 2). An efficient, advanced tool for performing both tasks is the Gibbs Energy Minimization (GEM) approach, implemented in the userfriendly GEM-Selector (GEMS) program package, which includes the Nagra-PSI chemical thermodynamic database.

  abstract     = {The data available in general for an equilibrium calculation are included in the set {\{}A, p*, N, AGO or K, “restrictions”{\}}, where A is the formula matrix for the species involved, p* are the standard chemical potentials or free energies of the species, N is the stoichiometric matrix, AGO and K are the standard free energies and equilibrium constants, respectively, of the reactions contained in N, and “restrictions” represent special constraints. It is shown how any alogrithm (based on free-energy-minimization methods) for computing chemical equilibrium that requires the species-related data set {\{}A, p*) can be used when only the reaction-related data set (N, K) is available (in which case algorithms based on the equilibrium-constant method are frequently used). This situation is common in ionic equilibria. Computational advantages of the free-energy-minimization method can only be exploited if species-related data are available. In addition to the usual case (single phase, “no restrictions”), special cases may arise involving stoichiometric restrictions (e.g., restricted equilibrium), compositional constraints (e.g., fixed pH), or additional phases (e.g., solubility). Examples taken from the literature are used to illustrate these situations. The techniques described, which are not restricted to ionic equilibria, involve converting the data given, and if appropriate, the formula vectors of the species, into standard form for use in the algorithm in the usual way}},

  abstract     = {The rate and magnitude of geochemical reactions can be described by two main processes; thermodynamics which determines the end point of reaction (i.e. approach to equilibrium conditions), and kinetics which determines how rapidly the reaction proceeds. There have been many studies that have investigated equilibrium conditions and have generated a wealth of data. However, for many systems the rate at which the end point of the reaction is reached is of equal, and possibly greater importance (e.g. the behaviour of waste products stored within the geosphere or during weathering). Predictive geochemical computer modelling is becoming increasingly important for investigating many different scenarios relatively rapidly. Although such models are capable of modelling rate-controlled dissolution and precipitation, there is no standard database of kinetic functions. As a consequence, it is sometimes difficult to locate sources of information to aid modelling. The overall aim of this report, is to provide information on literature sources of mainly mineral reaction rate data. It is hoped that this will facilitate predictive modelling exercises, or laboratory experimental studies addressing gaps in data coverage. Information on the sources of literature information has been produced in the form of an EndNote electronic database (see Appendix I). This study does not however, go as far as extracting and tabulating all the individual data points within these references.},

(2005) for human tumor T cells. The previous paper studied the downstream intracelluar-signaling subsystem, while the present one is concerned with the upstream death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) subsystem. Under the assumption that the bind of Fas-associated death domains and FLICE-inhibitory proteins to the DISC is much faster than that of the initiator procaspases, we greatly simplify the upstream subsystem from 35 reactions with 26 species to 6 reactions with 9 species by adopting the classical and recently justified partial equilibrium approximation method. Numerical simulations show that the simplified model is in an excellent agreement with the original model. Most importantly, the simplified model clearly reveals the key reactants and dominated pathways in the Fas signaling process, and thus provides new insights into the apoptosis.},

Temperature variation is neglected, but capillary effects are included by extended Darcy's law, and Fickian diffusion is taken into account. The efficiency and stability of the numerical method of Lake (1989) relies on an equivalent reformulation of the otherwise commonly used model in terms of new principal variables and subsequent static (flash) equations allowing more generally for any (dis)appearance of one of the phases without the need of variable switching or unphysical quantities. In particular, the formulation in terms of complementarity conditions allows for an efficient and stable solution by the semismooth Newton's method.},

  abstract     = {Gradient-based optimization problems are encountered in many fields, but the associated task of differentiating large computer algorithms can be formidable. The operator-overloading approach to performing reverse-mode automatic differentiation is the most convenient for the user but current implementations are typically 10-35 times slower than the original algorithm. In this paper a fast new operator-overloading method is presented that uses the expression template programming technique in C++ to provide a compile-time representation of each mathematical expression as a computational graph that can be efficiently traversed in either direction. Benchmarking with four different numerical algorithms shows this approach to be 2.6--9 times faster than current operator-overloading libraries, and 1.3--7.7 times more efficient in memory usage. It is typically less than 4 times the computational cost of the original algorithm, although poorer performance is found for all libraries in the case of simple loops containing no mathematical functions. An implementation is freely available in the Adept C++ software library.}

  abstract     = {Geochemical reaction path modeling is useful for rapidly assessing the extent of water-aqueous-gas interactions both in natural systems and in industrial processes. Modeling of some systems, such as those at low temperature with relatively high hydrologic flow rates, or those perturbed by the subsurface injection of industrial waste such as CO2 or H2S, must account for the relatively slow kinetics of mineral-gas-water interactions. We have therefore compiled parameters conforming to a general Arrhenius-type rate equation, for over 70 minerals, including phases from all the major classes of silicates, most carbonates, and many other non-silicates. The compiled dissolution rate constants range from -0.21 log moles m-2 s-1 for halite, to -17.44 log moles m-2 s-1 for kyanite, for conditions far from equilibrium, at 25 °C, and pH near neutral. These data have been added to a computer code that simulates an infinitely well-stirred batch reactor, allowing computation of mass transfer as a function of time. Actual equilibration rates are expected to be much slower than those predicted by the selected computer code, primarily because actual geochemical processes commonly involve flow through porous or fractured media, wherein the development of concentration gradients in the aqueous phase near mineral surfaces, which results in decreased absolute chemical affinity and slower reaction rates. Further differences between observed and computed reaction rates may occur because of variables beyond the scope of most geochemical simulators, such as variation in grain size, aquifer heterogeneity, preferred fluid flow paths, primary and secondary mineral coatings, and secondary minerals that may lead to decreased porosity and clogged pore throats.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of this work is to develop a general, reliable and efficient algorithm, which is able to deal with multiple reactions in multiphase systems. We selected the method of Lagrange multipliers to minimize the Gibbs energy of the system, under material balance constraints. Lagrange multipliers and phase amounts are the independent variables, whose initialization is performed by solving a subset of the working equations. This initialization is the unconstrained minimization of a convex function and it is bound to converge. The whole solution procedure employs a nested loop with Newton iteration in the inner loop and non-ideality updated in the outer loop, thus giving an overall linear convergence rate. Stability analysis is used to introduce additional phases sequentially so as to obtain the final multiphase solution. The procedure was successfully tested on vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) and vapor-liquid-liquid equilibrium (VLLE) of reaction systems.},

The model is based on the previously developed mixed-solvent electrolyte (MSE) framework, which has been designed for the simultaneous calculation of phase equilibria and speciation of electrolytes in aqueous, nonaqueous, and mixed solvents up to the saturation or pure solute limit. In the MSE framework, the standard-state properties of species are calculated from the Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers equation of state, whereas the excess Gibbs energy includes a long-range electrostatic interaction term expressed by a Pitzer-Debye-H{\"{u}}ckel equation, a virial coefficient-type term for interactions between ions and a short-range term for interactions involving neutral molecules. Model parameters have been established to reproduce the vapor pressures, solubilities of solids and gases, heat capacities, and densities for MEG + H2O + solute systems, where the solute is one or more of the following components: NaCl, KCl, CaCl2, Na 2SO4, K2SO4, CaSO4, BaSO4, Na2CO3, K2CO3, NaHCO3, KHCO3, CaCO3, HCl, CO2, H2S, and O2. In particular, emphasis has been put on accurately representing the solubilities of mineral scales, which commonly appear in oil and gas environments. Additionally, the model predicts the pH of mixed-solvent solutions up to high MEG contents. On the basis of speciation obtained from the thermodynamic model, the electrical conductivity of the MEG + H2O + NaCl + NaHCO3 solutions is also calculated over wide ranges of solvent composition and salt concentration. Additionally, associated models have been established to compute the thermal conductivity, viscosity, and surface tension of aqueous MEG mixtures. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract     = {The concentrations of Sr, Mg and other elements in calcite are widely used to infer the conditions of mineral growth. However, such inferences are dependent on the mechanisms that govern the incorporation of minor constituents into the calcite lattice during growth. A particularly confusing observation is that both Sr and Mg are readily incorporated into growing calcite crystals at low concentrations but inhibit calcite growth at higher concentrations. Here we show that the growth rate dependence of Sr and Mg incorporation into calcite, as well the inhibitory effects on calcite growth of both incorporating and non-incorporating ions, can be predicted with an ion-by-ion crystal growth model where ion attachment is confined to kink sites on the crystal surface.The exchange of ions between active growth (kink) sites on the mineral surface and aqueous solution governs both the efficiency of incorporation of minor constituents and the kinetics of mineral precipitation. Ions such as Sr and Mg in calcite, that are not stoichiometric constituents, may attach to kink sites and impede crystal growth by either blocking propagation of the kink (kink blocking), or if incorporated into the growing mineral, straining the local crystal lattice, and hence increasing the mineral solubility (incorporation inhibition). Here we investigate the effects of including these growth inhibition mechanisms into a microscopic model for crystal growth based on kink creation, propagation and collision (CPC) theory. This model predicts that kink blocking by either incorporated or non-incorporated ions causes an exponential decrease in mineral growth rate with increasing impurity concentration, while incorporation inhibition results in more complicated functional forms of the growth rate effect depending on the thermodynamics of the solid solution. Applying this model to existing data on the partitioning of strontium and magnesium into calcite and the simultaneous effects on growth kinetics and mineral composition, we find that strontium uptake inhibits growth by enhancing mineral solubility while magnesium inhibits growth primarily by kink blocking. Our model should be widely applicable to understanding the impurity content of a large range of sparingly soluble minerals that form by precipitation from aqueous solutions. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

First, we outline a numerical model capable of accounting for the thermophysical properties of geothermal fluids of arbitrary composition within simulations of geothermal power production. The behavior of brines with varying compositions from geothermal sites around the globe are then examined using the model. The effect of each brine on an idealized binary geothermal power plant is simulated, and their performances compared by calculating the amount of heat exchanged from the fluid to the plant's secondary cycle. Our simulations combine (1) a newly developed Non-linear Equation System Solver (NESS), for simulating individual geothermal power plant components, (2) the advanced geochemical speciation solver, Reaktoro, used for calculation of thermodynamic fluid properties, and (3) compositional models for the calculation of fluid-dynamical properties (e.g., viscosity as a function of temperature and brine composition). The accuracy of the model is verified by comparing its predictions with experimental data from single-salt, binary-salt, and multiple-salt solutions. The geothermal power plant simulations show that the brines considered in this study can be divided into three main categories: (1) those of largely meteoric origin with low salinity for which the effect of salt concentration is negligible; (2) moderate-depth brines with high concentrations of Na + and K + ions, whose performance is well approximated by pure NaCl solutions of equivalent salinity; and (3) deeper, high-salinity brines that require a more detailed consideration of their composition for accurate simulation of plant operations.},

  abstract     = {Calculating the solubility of gases and minerals at the high pressures of carbon capture and storage in geological reservoirs requires an accurate description of the molar volumes of aqueous species and the fugacity coefficients of gases. Existing methods for calculating the molar volumes of aqueous species are limited to a specific concentration matrix (often seawater), have been fit for a limited temperature (below 60. ??C) or pressure range, apply only at infinite dilution, or are defined for salts instead of individual ions. A more general and reliable calculation of apparent molar volumes of single ions is presented, based on a modified Redlich-Rosenfeld equation. The modifications consist of (1) using the Born equation to calculate the temperature dependence of the intrinsic volumes, following Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers (HKF), but with Bradley and Pitzer's expression for the dielectric permittivity of water, (2) using the pressure dependence of the extended Debye-H??ckel equation to constrain the limiting slope of the molar volume with ionic strength, and (3) adopting the convention that the proton has zero volume at all ionic strengths, temperatures and pressures. The modifications substantially reduce the number of fitting parameters, while maintaining or even extending the range of temperature and pressure over which molar volumes can be accurately estimated. The coefficients in the HKF-modified-Redlich-Rosenfeld equation were fitted by least-squares on measured solution densities.The limiting volume and attraction factor in the Van der Waals equation of state can be estimated with the Peng-Robinson approach from the critical temperature, pressure, and acentric factor of a gas. The Van der Waals equation can then be used to determine the fugacity coefficients for pure gases and gases in a mixture, and the solubility of the gas can be calculated from the fugacity, the molar volume in aqueous solution, and the equilibrium constant. The coefficients for the Peng-Robinson equations are readily available in the literature.The required equations have been implemented in PHREEQC, version 3, and the parameters for calculating the partial molar volumes and fugacity coefficients have been added to the databases that are distributed with PHREEQC. The ease of use and power of the formulation are illustrated by calculating the solubility of CO2 at high pressures and temperatures, and comparing with well-known examples from the geochemical literature. The equations and parameterizations are suitable for wide application in hydrogeochemical systems, especially in the field of carbon capture and storage. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The corrosion potential is calculated from a mixed-potential model that combines comprehensive thermodynamic speciation calculations with a detailed treatment of partial electrochemical processes that may occur on the metal surface. The mixed-potential model has been verified by calculating corrosion rates in mixed acids and corrosion potential as a function of pH and concentration of oxidizing species. The repassivation potential is calculated from a separate model that quantitatively considers competitive processes at metal/salt film/solution interfaces in the limit of repassivation. This model has been shown to be accurate for reproducing the repassivation potential for mixtures containing both aggressive and inhibitive ions. Furthermore, a generalized correlation has been established to relate the repassivation potential to alloy composition. The combined predictive methodology has been validated by calculating the critical crevice temperature for a number of nickelbase alloys.},

  abstract     = {A recently developed model for predicting the repassivation potential has been applied to stainless steels and nickel-base alloys in aqueous environments containing chlorides and various inhibiting anions. The model accounts for the effects of solution chemistry and temperature on the repassivation of localized corrosion by considering competitive dissolution, adsorption, and oxide formation processes at the interface between the metal and the occluded site solution. An extensive database of repassivation potentials has been established for six alloys (UNS 31603, N06600, N06690, S31254, S32205, and UNS S41425) in contact with solutions that combine chlorides with hydroxides, molybdates, vanadates, sulfates, nitrates, and nitrites at various concentrations and temperatures. Also, repassivation potentials are reported for four alloys (UNS N08367, N08800, N06625, and N10276) in chloride solutions. The database has been used to establish the parameters of the model and verify its accuracy. The model quantitatively predicts the transition between concentrations at which localized corrosion is possible and those at which inhibition is expected. It is capable of predicting the repassivation potential over wide ranges of experimental conditions using parameters that can be generated from a limited number of experimental data. The parameters of the model have been generalized as a function of alloy composition, thus making it possible to predict the repassivation potential for alloys that have not been experimentally investigated. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract     = {A program has been developed for generating stability diagrams that concisely represent the thermodynamic state of multicomponent, multiphase aqueous systems in wide ranges of temperature and component concentrations. The diagrams are based on a thermodynamic model that combines the Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers equation of state for standard-state properties with a solutions nonideality model based on the activity coefficient expressions developed by Bromley and Pitzer. The diagrams offer a flexible choice of independent variables, which include component concentrations in addition to the potential and pH. The stability diagrams are used to predict the conditions that favor the formation of stable and metastable iron sulfide species, which are commonly deposited under oil field-related conditions. First, the diagrams have been applied to establish a sequence of transformations that iron sulfides undergo as they age. The predicted transformation sequences take into account environmental variables (e.g., hydrogen sulfide concentration, oxygen availability, etc.). The predictions are in agreement with experimental data on iron sulfide formation at the iron/solution interface and in bulk solution. The understanding of iron sulfide transformation sequences makes it possible to simulate experimental studies of H2S/CO2 corrosion in the presence or absence of oxygen. A comparison with laboratory corrosion rate data under gas pipeline conditions indicates that the magnitude of corrosion rates can be correlated with the predicted stability of metastable iron sulfide phases.},

  abstract     = {The interaction between CO2-rich waters and basaltic glass was studied using reaction path modeling in order to get insight into the water-rock reaction process including secondary mineral composition, water chemistry and mass transfer as a function of CO2 concentration and reaction progress ($\xi$). The calculations were carried out at 25-90°C and pCO2 to 30bars and the results were compared to recent experimental observations and natural systems. A thermodynamic dataset was compiled from 25 to 300°C in order to simulate mineral saturations relevant to basalt alteration in CO2-rich environment including revised key aqueous species for mineral dissolution reactions and apparent Gibbs energies for clay and carbonate solid solutions observed to form in nature. The dissolution of basaltic glass in CO2-rich waters was found to be incongruent with the overall water composition and secondary mineral formation depending on reaction progress and pH. Under mildly acid conditions in CO2 enriched waters (pH {\textless}6.5), SiO2 and simple Al-Si minerals, Ca-Mg-Fe smectites and Ca-Mg-Fe carbonates predominated. Iron, Al and Si were immobile whereas the Mg and Ca mobility depended on the mass of carbonate formed and water pH. Upon quantitative CO2 mineralization, the pH increased to {\textgreater}8 resulting in Ca-Mg-Fe smectite, zeolites and calcite formation, reducing the mobility of most dissolved elements. The dominant factor determining the reaction path of basalt alteration and the associated element mobility was the pH of the water. In turn, the pH value was determined by the concentration of CO2 and extent of reaction. The composition of the carbonates depended on the mobility of Ca, Mg and Fe. At pH {\textless}6.5, Fe was in the ferrous oxidation state resulting in the formation of Fe-rich carbonates with the incorporation of Ca and Mg. At pH {\textgreater}8, the mobility of Fe and Mg was limited due to the formation of clays whereas Ca was incorporated into calcite, zeolites and clays. Competing reactions between clays (Ca-Fe smectites) and carbonates at low pH, and zeolites and clays (Mg-Fe smectites) and carbonates at high pH, controlled the availability of Ca, Mg and Fe, playing a key role for low temperature CO2 mineralization and sequestration into basalts. Several problems of the present model point to the need of improvement in future work. The determinant factors linking time to low temperature reaction path modeling may not only be controlled by the primary dissolving phase, which presents challenges concerning non-stoichiometric dissolution, the leached layer model and reactive surface area, but may include secondary mineral precipitation kinetics as rate limiting step for specific reactions such as retrieved from the present reaction path study. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.}

  abstract     = {Until recently the influence of solution stoichiometry on calcite crystal growth kinetics has attracted little attention, despite the fact that in most aqueous environments calcite precipitates from non-stoichiometric solution. In order to account for the dependence of the calcite crystal growth rate on the cation to anion ratio in solution, we extend the growth model for binary symmetrical electrolyte crystals of Zhang and Nancollas (1998) by combining it with the surface complexation model for the chemical structure of the calcite-aqueous solution interface of Wolthers et al. (2008). To maintain crystal stoichiometry, the rate of attachment of calcium ions to step edges is assumed to equal the rate of attachment of carbonate plus bicarbonate ions. The model parameters are optimized by fitting the model to the step velocities obtained previously by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Teng et al., 2000; Stack and Grantham, 2010). A variable surface roughness factor is introduced in order to reconcile the new process-based growth model with bulk precipitation rates measured in seeded calcite growth experiments. For practical applications, we further present empirical parabolic rate equations fitted to bulk growth rates of calcite in common background electrolytes and in artificial seawater-type solutions. Both the process-based and empirical growth rate equations agree with measured calcite growth rates over broad ranges of ionic strength, pH, solution stoichiometry and degree of supersaturation. {\textcopyright}2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract     = {Ferrous iron bio-oxidation by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans immobilized on polyurethane foam was investigated. Cells were immobilized on foams by placing them in a growth environment and fully bacterially activated polyurethane foams (BAPUFs) were prepared by serial subculturing in batches with partially bacterially activated foam (pBAPUFs). The dependence of foam density on cell immobilization process, the effect of pH and BAPUF loading on ferrous oxidation were studied to choose operating parameters for continuous operations. With an objective to have high cell densities both in foam and the liquid phase, pretreated foams of density 50 kg/m(3) as cell support and ferrous oxidation at pH 1.5 to moderate the ferric precipitation were preferred. A novel basket-type bioreactor for continuous ferrous iron oxidation, which features a multiple effect of stirred tank in combination with recirculation, was designed and operated. The results were compared with that of a free cell and a sheet-type foam immobilized reactors. A fivefold increase in ferric iron productivity at 33.02 g/h/L of free volume in foam was achieved using basket-type bioreactor when compared to a free cell continuous system. A mathematical model for ferrous iron oxidation by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans cells immobilized on polyurethane foam was developed with cell growth in foam accounted by an effectiveness factor. The basic parameters of simulation were estimated using the experimental data on free cell growth as well as from cell attachment to foam under nongrowing conditions. The model predicted the phase of both oxidation of ferrous in shake flasks by pBAPUFs as well as by fully activated BAPUFs for different cell loadings in foam. Model for stirred tank basket bioreactor predicted within 5{\%} both transient and steady state of the experiments closely for the simulated dilution rates. Bio-oxidation at high Fe(2+) concentrations were simulated with experiments when substrate and product inhibition coefficients were factored into cell growth kinetics.

For the analysis, imidazolium-based ionic liquids and their mixtures with water and organic solvents have been selected. The ionic liquids are treated as dissociable species that are subject to chemical speciation equilibria. The parameters of the model are determined from available thermodynamic property data including phase equilibria, activity coefficients, osmotic coefficients, enthalpies of mixing and dilution, and heat capacities. Subsequently, electrical conductivities and viscosities are calculated using the chemical speciation obtained from thermodynamic analysis. The modeling framework has been designed to reproduce the properties of ionic solutions at temperatures ranging from the freezing point to 300 °C and concentrations ranging from infinite dilution to the fused salt limit. The accuracy of the thermodynamic model has been verified by calculating vapor-liquid, liquid-liquid, and solid-liquid equilibria in wide ranges of composition and temperature. In view of the strong dependence of electrical conductivity and, secondarily, viscosity on the ionic concentration, the accurate representation of transport properties confirms that the thermodynamic speciation results are reasonable, thus verifying the applicability of the computational framework to modeling multiple thermophysical properties of ionic liquid systems. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract     = {Chemical absorption using amine solutions is a promising technology for post combustion CO2 Capture (PCC) from flue gas. Monoethanolamine (MEA) aqueous solution has been used in many projects as a benchmark solution and the experimental and analytical results are available in the literature for diverse operating conditions. Aspen Plus{\textregistered} is a widely used computational simulation software for design of PCC systems including operating conditions. Two example files of rate-based MEA models using electrolyte non-random two liquid (e-NRTL) methods are included in Aspen Plus. Basically, e-NRTL models can provide relatively accurate results by fitting parameters to experimental data within a limited temperature and concentration range. However, there are a non-negligible difference between experimental and calculation results, especially in regard to the vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) at high temperatures and high MEA concentrations. This paper updates the e-NRTL model for the solutions with 30 wt{\%} and higher MEA by data regression of the specific heat capacity, the heat of CO2 absorption, and VLE experimental data obtained at high temperatures. Since these thermodynamic properties are mutually dependent and affected by internal model parameters such as activity coefficients, standard enthalpy change of formation of principal ions, all properties in the MEA-H2O-CO2 ternary system that are consistent with the MEA-H2O binary system were fitted by using a combination of the built-in data regression functionality and external spread-sheet software. The updated model more accurately simulates thermodynamic properties of high concentration MEA solutions at high temperatures.},

Most of the procedures extend known ones from the linear to quadratic cases, but a few new preprocessing techniques are introduced.  The implementation aspects are also discussed.  Numerical results are finally presented to indicate the potential of the resulting code, both for linear and quadratic problems.  The impact of insisting that bounds of the variables in the reduced problem be as tight as possible rather than allowing some slack in these bounds is also shown to be numerically significant.},

  abstract     = {We formulate an algorithm for the calculation of stable phase relations of a system with constrained bulk composition as a function of its environmental variables. The basis of this algorithm is the approximate representation of the free energy composition surfaces of solution phases by inscribed polyhedra. This representation leads to discretization of high variance phase fields into a continuous mesh of smaller polygonal fields within which the composition and physical properties of the phases are uniquely determined. The resulting phase diagram sections are useful for understanding the phase relations of complex metamorphic systems and for applications in which it is necessary to establish the variations in rock properties such as density, seismic velocities and volatile-content through a metamorphic cycle. The algorithm has been implemented within a computer program that is general with respect to both the choice of variables and the number of components and phases possible in a system, and is independent of the structure of the equations of state used to describe the phases of the system.}

It combines two individual nonstoichiometric solving procedures: a nested-loop method with successive substitution for the first steps and final convergence with the second-order modified RAND method. The modified RAND extends the classical RAND method from single-phase chemical reaction equilibrium of ideal systems to multiphase chemical equilibrium of nonideal systems. All components in all phases are treated in the same manner and the system Gibbs energy can be used to monitor convergence. This is the first time that modified RAND was applied to multiphase chemical equilibrium systems. The combined algorithm was tested using nine examples covering vapor-liquid (VLE) and vapor-liquid-liquid equilibria (VLLE) of ideal and nonideal reaction systems. Successive substitution provided good initial estimates for the accelerated computation with modified RAND, to ultimately converge to the equilibrium solution without failure.},

Here we used COMSOL to solve Richards' equation for aqueous phase flow in variably saturated porous media. The coupling procedure presented is in principle applicable to any simulation of aqueous phase flow and solute transport in COMSOL. The coupling with IPhreeqc gives major advantages over COMSOL's built-in reaction capabilities, i.e., the soil solution is speciated from its element composition according to thermodynamic mass action equations with ion activity corrections. State-of-the-art adsorption models such as surface complexation with diffuse double layer calculations are accessible. In addition, IPhreeqc provides a framework to integrate user-defined kinetic reactions with possible dependencies on solution speciation (i.e., pH, saturation indices, and ion activities), allowing for modelling of microbially mediated reactions. Extensive compilations of geochemical reactions and their parameterization are accessible through associated databases. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract     = {A moderately complex hydrogen-oxygen reaction system is used to demonstrate the application of the Computational Singular Perturbation (CSP) technique. Most of the “insights” normally clained by theoreticians after a successful convenient singular perturbation analysis on “tractable” problems can be obtained for highly complex problems using data generated by CSP, including simplified multi-step reaction models. The basic idea of CSP is that the large number of physically meaningful elementary reactions in a complex reaciion system can be grouped into separate reaction groups each identified with a single characteristic time scale. CSP theory provides an exact algorithm for the determination of this grouping and the reaction rates of earch of the groups, requiring no experience or intuition about the reaction system from the invetigator. terms representing fast reaction groups can simply be discarded when they are exhausted to yield simplified models of the reaction system as a function of time. Examples are given to show how physically meaningful information about the reaction system can be derived when relevant CSP data are available. Sample calculations are performed for the hydrogen-oxygen reaction system at 16]]° K and low pressure CSP. Examination of the CSP data suggests that, when [H], [O], [OH], [H2O], and [HO2] are present initially only in trace amounts, the reaction system can be represented reasonably accurately by a single set of 5 reaction groups (two extremely fast, two moderately fast, and one extremely slow) over an extended time period. Depending on the interest of the invetigator, different simplified multi-step reaction models can be derived to represent the full kinetics formulation.},

  abstract     = {Computational methods in chemical equilibrium thermodynamics have found numerous application areas in diverse fields such as metallurgy, petrochemistry, the pulp and paper industry, the study of advanced inorganic materials, environmental science and biochemistry. As many of the cases of interest are not actually in equilibrium, there is a need for methods that extend the application area of multiphase equilibrium solvers to non-equilibrium systems. Likewise there is a need for efficient handling of thermochemical systems that are described by parameters other than those most commonly associated with Gibbs energy, namely temperature, pressure and fixed elemental (and charge) balances. In the work computational methods and related theory are presented that can be used with a standard Gibbs energy minimiser to solve advanced thermochemical problems. The actual calculations have been performed using the ChemSheet software, but the presentation has aimed to be generic and applicable to other thermochemical codes that allow the user to define thermodynamic data and the stoichiometries of the constituent species in the system. The examples discussed include electrochemical Donnan equilibrium (particularly applied to aqueous pulp suspensions), surface and interfacial energies of liquid mixtures, systems affected by external magnetic fields and systems with time-dependent reaction extents and diffusion-constrained paraequilibrium. A number of practical applications have been achieved with the models that combine reaction kinetics with partial thermodynamic equilibrium calculation and ion exchange models based on Donnan equilibrium, that have both been applied with success in real-life industrial design and development work with multicomponent, multiphase systems. The method has been successfully applied to liquid surface energies of systems with multiple components and complex non-equilibrium data.},

  abstract     = {AIM: To determine whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to categorize small bowel Crohn's disease (SB CD) into groups that correlate with response to medical therapy and surgical pathology. METHODS: Data was collected from all patients with MRI evidence of SB CD without significant colonic disease over a 32-mo period. Two radiologists, blinded to clinical findings, evaluated each MRI and grouped them based on bowel wall thickness and wall enhancement. These categories were: (1) "fibrosis", (2) "mild segmental hyper-enhancement and mild wall thickening", (3) "mild segmental hyper-enhancement and marked wall thickening", (4) "marked segmental transmural hyper-enhancement". Patient response to additional medical therapy post-MRI was prospectively determined at 8-wk. Non-responders underwent endoscopy and were offered therapeutic endoscopy or surgery. Surgical pathology was assessed against the MRI category. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were included. Females and category "2" patients were more likely, and patients with luminal narrowing and hold-up less likely, to respond to medical therapy (P {\textless} 0.05). Seventeen patients underwent surgery. The surgical pathological findings of fibrosis and the severity of inflammation correlated with the MRI category in all cases. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that SB CD can be grouped by the MRI findings and that these groups are associated with patients more likely to respond to continued medical therapy. The MRI categories also correlated with the presence and level of intestinal inflammation and fibrosis on surgical pathology, and may be of prognostic use in the management of CD patients.},

Best results are obtained when combining the solubility correlations of Spycher et al. (2003) with the activity coefficient formulation of Rumpf et al. (1994) and Duan and Sun (2003), which can be extended to chloride solutions other than NaCl. This approach allows computing mutual solubilities in a noniterative manner with an accuracy typically within experimental uncertainty for solutions up to 6 molal NaCl and 4 molal CaCl2.

Each iteration forms linear approximations to the objective and constraint functions by interpolation at the vertices of a simplex and a trust region bound restricts each change to the variables. Thus a new vector of variables is calculated, which may replace one of the current vertices, either to improve the shape of the simplex or because it is the best vector that has been found so far, according to a merit function that gives attention to the greatest constraint violation. The trust region radius {\$}\rho{\$} is never increased, and it is reduced when the approximations of a well-conditioned simplex fail to yield an improvement to the variables, until {\$}\rho{\$} reaches a prescribed value that controls the final accuracy. Some convergence properties and several numerical results are given, but there are no more than 9 variables in these calculations because linear approximations can be highly inefficient. Nevertheless, the algorithm is easy to use for small numbers of variables.},

  abstract     = {A method is presented for calculating equilibrium phase assemblages in very nonideal systems. It may be applied to any system for which a thermodynamically consistent model of the free energy which satisfies the usual Maxwell relations and convexity criterion is available. The algorithm minimizes the Gibbs free energy by independently choosing stable reaction directions. The procedure is described in detail and various numerical problems encountered and strategies for dealing with them are discussed. It will be shown that the necessary and sufficient conditions for solution phase selection may be derived from the values of the Lagrange multipliers corresponding to constraints on phases that are not present in the system. The method for evaluating the solution phase Lagrangian multipliers and choosing the optimum composition with which to bring the new solution phase into the system involves a separate constrained minimization problem. This method is sufficiently general so that the correct phase assemblage is chosen free from external control. Special procedures for adding and removing phases including solution phases are also described. ?? 1987.},

  abstract     = {Chemical equilibrium calculations are essential for many environmental problems. It is also a fundamental tool for chemical kinetics and reactive transport modelling, since these applications may require hundreds to billions equilibrium calculations in a single simulation. Therefore, an equilibrium method for such critical applications must be very efficient, robust and accurate. In this work we demonstrate the potential effectiveness of a novel Gibbs energy minimisation algorithm for reactive transport simulations. The algorithm includes strategies to converge from poor initial guesses; capabilities to specify non-linear equilibrium constraints such as pH of an aqueous solution and activity or fugacity of a species; a rigorous phase stability test to determine the unstable phases; and a strategy to boost the convergence speed of the calculations to quadratic rates, requiring only few iterations to converge. We use this equilibrium method to solve geochemical problems relevant to carbon storage in saline aquifers, where aqueous, gaseous and minerals phases are present. The problems are formulated to mimic the ones found in kinetics and transport simulations, where a sequence of equilibrium calculations are performed, each one using the previous solution as the initial guess. The efficiency and convergence rates of the calculations are presented, which require an average of 1-2 iterations. These results indicate that critical applications such as chemical kinetics and reactive transport modelling can potentially benefit by using this multiphase equilibrium algorithm. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

  abstract     = {As our industrial and infrastructure systems (refineries, power plants, pipelines, etc.) age, there is a considerable economic incentive to avoid unscheduled outages and to extend operation beyond the design lifetime. The avoidance of unscheduled outages is of particular interest, because the failure of even a minor component can result in the complete shutdown of a facility. For example, the unscheduled shutdown of a 1000. MWe nuclear power plant due to the failure of a valve may cost the operator between {\$}1. million and {\$}3. million per day, depending upon the cost of replacement power and other factors. However, if component failures could be accurately predicted, maintenance could be performed during scheduled outages, the cost of which has already been built into the price of the product, thereby minimizing the economic impact of the failure. With regard to life extension, the successful extension of operation beyond the design life translates into enhanced profits and the avoidance of costly licensing and environmental impact assessments associated with the development and construction of a new facility. However, in this case as well, the key to successful operation is the ability to avoid unscheduled downtime and hence maintain continuity of production. However, eventually, the frequency and severity of unscheduled outages render continued operation uneconomic and, at that point, replacement of the facility becomes necessary. Corrosion is a major cause of component failure, and hence the occurrence of unscheduled downtime, in complex industrial systems. In particular, the various forms of localized corrosion, including pitting corrosion, crevice corrosion, stress corrosion cracking (SCC), and corrosion fatigue (to name the common forms), are particularly deleterious, because they frequently occur without any outward sign of accumulating damage and because they often result in sudden and catastrophic failures. Thus, the development of effective general and especially localized corrosion damage prediction technologies is essential for the successful avoidance of unscheduled downtime and for the successful implementation of life extension strategies. . {\textcopyright} 2010 Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {Saturn's largest moon, Titan, has an atmosphere and surface that are rich in organic compounds. Liquid hydrocarbons exist on the surface, most famously as lakes. Photochemical reactions produce solid organics in Titan's atmosphere, and these materials settle or snow onto the surface. At the surface, liquids can interact with solids, and geochemical processes can occur. The consequences of these processes can be explored using a thermodynamic model to calculate the solubilities of gases and solids in liquid hydrocarbons at cryogenic temperatures. The van Laar model developed in this study was parameterized using experimental phase equilibrium data, and accurately represents the data for the CH4-C2H6-C3H8-N2-C2H2 chemical system from 90 to 110K. The model generally gives more accurate results than existing models. The model also features a suitable balance between accuracy and simplicity, and can serve as a foundation for studies of fluvial geochemistry on Titan because it can be extended to any number of components while maintaining thermodynamic consistency. Application of the model to Titan reveals that the equilibrium composition of surface liquids depends on the abundance of methane gas in the local atmosphere, consistent with prior studies. The concentration of molecular nitrogen in Titan's lakes varies inversely with the ethane content of the lakes. The model indicates that solid acetylene should be quite soluble in surface liquids, which implies that acetylene-rich sedimentary rocks would be susceptible to chemical erosion, and acetylene evaporites may form on Titan. The geochemical character of acetylene in liquid hydrocarbons on Titan appears to be intermediate to those of calcite and gypsum in surface waters on Earth. Specific recommendations are given of observational, experimental, and theoretical work that will lead to significant advancements in our knowledge of geochemical processes on Titan. This paper represents the beginning of a new kind of geochemistry, called cryogenic fluvial geochemistry, with Titan starring as the first example. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

By analyzing the construction of Q-functions through Legendre transforms, we extend this approach to the flash for open systems in the absence or presence of chemical reactions, resulting in general formulations for various specifications. For systems without reactions, the classical framework using mole numbers as independent variables is employed; for those with reactions, the modified-RAND framework is employed. We present examples for open systems at constant temperature and pressure. Using the Q-function minimization, we can solve multicomponent nonreactive or reactive systems at a specified chemical potential with quadratic convergence over a wide range of conditions.},

It is shown that CrCl3 is an active Lewis acid catalyst in glucose isomerization to fructose, and the combined Lewis and Br{\o}nsted acid catalysts perform the isomerization and dehydration/rehydration reactions. A CrCl3 speciation model in conjunction with kinetics results indicates that the hydrolyzed Cr(III) complex [Cr(H2O)5OH]2+ is the most active Cr species in glucose isomerization and probably acts as a Lewis acid-Br{\o}nsted base bifunctional site. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations indicate a strong interaction between the Cr cation and the glucose molecule whereby some water molecules are displaced from the first coordination sphere of Cr by the glucose to enable ring-opening and isomerization of glucose. Additionally, complex interactions between the two catalysts are revealed: Br{\o}nsted acidity retards aldose-to-ketose isomerization by decreasing the equilibrium concentration of [Cr(H2O)5OH]2+. In contrast, Lewis acidity increases the overall rate of consumption of fructose and HMF compared to Br{\o}nsted acid catalysis by promoting side reactions. Even in the absence of HCl, hydrolysis of Cr(III) decreases the solution pH, and this intrinsic Br{\o}nsted acidity drives the dehydration and rehydration reactions. Yields of 46{\%} levulinic acid in a single phase and 59{\%} HMF in a biphasic system have been achieved at moderate temperatures by combining CrCl3 and HCl. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract     = {Engineered geothermal systems represent a significant unutilized energy source, with the potential to assist in meeting growing energy demands with clean, renewable energy. Traditional geothermal systems use water as the working fluid. An alternative working fluid is carbon dioxide which offers potential benefits including favorable thermodynamic and transport properties and the potential for sequestration. An important feature is that CO2 does not dissolve mineral salts, and this will serve to reduce fouling and corrosion problems which afflict piping and surface equipment in conventional water cycles. Our modeling shows that a CO2-based power plant has net electricity production comparable to the traditional approach, but with a much simpler design, and demonstrates the comparative efficacy of CO2 as a heat extraction and working fluid. While the economic viability of a CO2-based system remains to be proven, this analysis provides a starting point for more detailed thermodynamic and economic models of engineered geothermal systems power conversion utilizing CO2. 1.}

For the alternative refrigerant HFC-32 (CH2F2), we perform direct simulations of the isenthalpic integral Joule-Thomson effect (temperature drop) resulting from Joule-Thomson expansion from an initial pressure to the representative final pressure of 1 bar. We consider representative expansions from single-phase states yielding final states in both single-phase and two-phase regions. We also predict the dependence of T(P,h) and of the Joule-Thomson coefficient, ?(P,h), on pressure along several representative isenthalps, as well as points on the Joule-Thomson inversion curve. HFC-32 is modelled using a five-site potential taken from the literature, with parameters derived from ab initio calculations and vapour-liquid equilibrium data. The simulated results show excellent agreement with those calculated from an international standard equation of state.},

  abstract     = {The problem of chemical mass transfer-calculation of complete and/or restricted chemical equilibrium states in multiphase and multiaggregate systems-is reduced to the convex programming problem. A related set-theory notation is introduced for complex physico-chemical models. It is used to represent the explicit analytical expressions for chemical potentials of species or dependent components both in symmetric and asymmetric reference scales. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the complete and metastable equilibrium states are formulated as Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the convex programming problem, including one-or two-sided restrictions that may be imposed on some or all sought-for molar quantities of dependent components, Such restrictions permit to simulate the metastable the states for individual. species, phases, and subsystems in the system under study. The chemical equilibrium problem is solved both for prime variables (sought-for molar quantities of dependent components) and dual variables (sought- for values of chemical potentials of stoichiometric units, or independent components, in the system). An Interior Points Method (IPM) algorithm is an efficient tool for Gibbs free energy numerical minimization regarding one-and two-sided restrictions without increase in the dimensionality of the iterational equations system of the order defined by the number of independent components, By means of the same algorithm, a feasible initial approximation can always be computed automatically from the entire list of dependent components that may be potentially present in equilibrium, The approach to the global minimum point is explicitly identified when the necessary and sufficient Kuhn-Tucker conditions are met, The minimization of total Gibbs free energy in highly nonideal systems is made persistent and fast by introducing a smoothing parameter that restricts increments of activity coefficients of dependent components as functions of system composition between subsequent iterations of IPM. Theoretical considerations are illustrated by numerical examples. The calculation of total equilibrium in the highly non-ideal case is presented for a very rigid system including silicate melt Parametric minimization of Helmholtz potential under conditions of total and restricted equilibria is shown by an example of the system containing aqueous solution, gas phase, liquid hydrocarbon mixture, and solid carbon.},

  abstract     = {CO₂ injection in oil reservoirs provides the dual benefit of increasing oil recovery as well as sequestration. Compositional simulations using phase behavior calculations are used to model miscibility and estimate oil recovery. The injected CO₂, however, is known to react with brine. The precipitation and dissolution reactions, especially with carbonate rocks, can have undesirable consequences. The geochemical reactions can also change the mole numbers of components and impact the phase behavior of hydrocarbons. A Gibbs free energy framework that integrates phase equilibrium computations and geochemical reactions is presented in this dissertation. This framework uses the Gibbs free energy function to unify different phase descriptions - Equation of State (EOS) for hydrocarbon components and activity coefficient model for aqueous phase components. A Gibbs free energy minimization model was developed to obtain the equilibrium composition for a system with not just phase equilibrium (no reactions) but also phase and chemical equilibrium (with reactions). This model is adaptable to different reservoirs and can be incorporated in compositional simulators. The Gibbs free energy model is used for two batch calculation applications. In the first application, solubility models are developed for acid gases (CO₂ /H2 S) in water as well as brine at high pressures (0.1 - 80 MPa) and high temperatures (298-393 K). The solubility models are useful for formulating acid gas injection schemes to ensure continuous production from contaminated gas fields as well as for CO₂ sequestration. In the second application, the Gibbs free energy approach is used to predict the phase behavior of hydrocarbon mixtures - CO₂ -nC₁₄ H₃₀ and CH₄ -CO2. The Gibbs free energy model is also used to predict the impact of geochemical reactions on the phase behavior of these two hydrocarbon mixtures. The Gibbs free energy model is integrated with flow using operator splitting to model an application of cation exchange reactions between aqueous phase and the solid surface. A 1-D numerical model to predict effluent concentration for a system with three cations using the Gibbs free energy minimization approach was observed to be faster than an equivalent stoichiometric approach. Analytical solutions were also developed for this system using the hyperbolic theory of conservation laws and are compared with experimental results available at laboratory and field scales.},

The computational approach combines an excess Gibbs energy model with a formulation for standard-state properties of individual species and an algorithm for speciation calculations. Using this framework, a consistent methodology has been established to calculate the pH of mixed-solvent solutions using a single, aqueous reference state. It has been shown that solid solubilities, vapor-liquid equilibria, solution pH and other properties can be reproduced for mixed solvents ranging from pure water to pure non-aqueous components and for solutes ranging from infinite dilution to the fused salt limit. In particular, the model has been shown to be accurate for mixtures containing hydrogen peroxide and ethylene glycol as solvents and various salts, acids and bases as solutes. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {Rate-controlled constrained equilibrium provides a sound framework for deriving and testing low-dimensional models of combustion chemistry, yet its application so far has been limited. The purpose of this paper is twofold: to propose a formulation of RCCE as a differential-algebraic problem and show how existing formulations such as the constraint potentials can be derived from it, and to demonstrate how combustion problems involving flow, such as nonpremixed laminar flames, can be solved with RCCE. A 9-constraint set is employed to reduce a 63-species detailed mechanism for CH4-air combustion and is found to be sufficient for fairly accurate predictions of both ignition in a homogeneous reactor and the structure of nonpremixed laminar flames for a variety of strain rates, while the main features of the latter can also be reproduced with a 7-constraint subset. {\textcopyright} 2005 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Combustion Institute.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the work of Cooper {\&} Showman, we revisit the chemical relaxation method, which seeks to enhance the computational efficiency of chemical-kinetics calculations by replacing the chemical network with a handful of independent source/sink terms. Chemical relaxation solves the evolution of the system and can treat disequilibrium chemistry, as the source/sink terms are driven towards chemical equilibrium on a prescribed chemical timescale, but it has surprisingly never been validated. First, we generalize the treatment by forgoing the use of a single chemical timescale, instead developing a pathway analysis tool that allows us to identify the rate-limiting reaction as a function of temperature and pressure. For the interconversion between methane and carbon monoxide and between ammonia, and molecular nitrogen, we identify the key rate-limiting reactions for conditions relevant to currently characterizable exo-atmospheres (500-3000 K, 0.1 mbar to 1 kbar). Second, we extend chemical relaxation to include carbon dioxide and water. Third, we examine the role of metallicity and carbon-to-oxygen ratio in chemical relaxation. Fourth, we apply our pathway analysis tool to diagnose the differences between our chemical network and that of Moses and Venot. Finally, we validate the chemical relaxation method against full chemical kinetics calculations in one dimension. For WASP-18b-, HD 189733b- and GJ 1214-b-like atmospheres, we show that chemical relaxation is mostly accurate to within an order of magnitude, a factor of 2 and {\$}\backslashsim 10\backslash{\%}{\$}, respectively. The level of accuracy attained allows for the chemical relaxation method to be included in three-dimensional general circulation models.},

  abstract     = {Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations in compositional flow simulators are used to find the partitioning of components among fluid phases, and they can be a time consuming kernel in a compo-sitional flow simulation. We describe a tie-line-based compositional space parameterization (CSP) approach for dealing with immiscible gas-injection processes with large numbers of components. The multicomponent multiphase equilibrium problem is recast in terms of this parameterized compositional space, in which the solution path can be represented in a concise manner. This tie-line-based parameterization approach is used to speed up the phase behavior calculations of standard compositional simulation. Two schemes are employed. In the first method, the parameterization of the phase behavior is computed in a preprocessing step, and the results are stored in a table. During the course of a simulation, the flash calcu-lation procedure is replaced by the solution of a multidimensional optimization problem in terms of the parameterized space. For processes where significant changes in pressure and temperature take place, this optimization procedure is combined with linear interpolation in tie-line space. In the second method, compositional space adaptive tabulation (CSAT) is used to accelerate the equation of state (EOS) computations associated with standard compositional reservoir simulation. The CSAT strategy takes advantage of the fact that, in gas injection processes, the solution path involves a limited number of tie-lines. The adaptively collected tie-lines are used to avoid redundant phase-stability checks in the course of a flow simu-lation. Specifically, we check if a given composition belongs to one of the tie-lines (or its extension) already in the table. If not, a new tie-line is computed and added to the table. The CSAT technique was implemented in a general-purpose research simulator (GPRS), which is designed for compositional flow simulation on unstruc-tured grids. Using a variety of challenging models, we show that, for immiscible compositional processes, CSAT leads to significant speed up (at least a several-fold improvement) of the EOS calcula-tions compared with standard techniques.

  abstract     = {ABSTRACT A general model has been developed for predicting the occurrence of localized corrosion in multicomponent electrolyte solutions. The model is based on calculating the repassivation and corrosion potentials as functions of solution composition and temperature. For the corrosion potential, a previously developed mixed-potential model is used. For the repassivation potential, a new model has been developed on the basis of nonequilibrium thermodynamics of metal dissolution within a pit or crevice. The model assumes that the status of localized corrosion is determined by competitive processes at the metal - salt film - solution interfaces leading to either metal salt or oxide formation. To calibrate and verify the model, an extensive database of repassivation potentials has been established for eleven alloys (UNS N06022, N10276, N06625, N08825, N06600, N06690, N08800, N08367, S31254, S31603 and S41425). The model successfully predicts the observed effects of aggressive species, such as chloride and bromide, inhibiting species, such as nitrate, and non-aggressive species, such as acetate, on the repassivation potential. A generalized correlation has been established to relate the repassivation potential to alloy composition. Further, the model has been validated by predicting the critical crevice temperature in FeCl3 solutions. INTRODUCTION Localized corrosion is controlled by a multitude of factors such as the chemistry of the aqueous system, concentrations of components, temperature and alloy composition. Therefore, it is desirable to rationalize and predict the effects of these factors whenever a need arises to design chemical process equipment, mitigate existing corrosion problems, etc. Predicting localized corrosion based only on the knowledge of process parameters has been considered an impossible task until recently. However, advances in the understanding of parameters governing localized corrosion and the ability to calculate these parameters on the basis of thermophysical and electrochemical principles can open new possibilities for assessing the performance of an alloy once the process parameters are known. Although experimental and plant corrosion data are still the best guides for performance prediction, computational models can provide guidelines for process modifications or materials selection. The objective of this paper is to describe such a predictive model and verify it using well-defined experimental data. A separate paper will show the results of plant tests that further validate the model.Localized corrosion occurs when the corrosion potential of an alloy in a given environment exceeds a critical potential1. While this concept is well accepted, the definition of critical potential is still debated. In the approach described in this paper, the repassivation potential is used as the critical potential for localized corrosion. The repassivation potential (also called the protection potential) is the potential at which a stably growing pit or crevice corrosion will cease to grow. The use of the repassivation potential is generally criticized on the basis of two lines of argument: (1) the measured repassivation potential decreases with an increase in pit depth and, because of this, the repassivation potential measured on shallow pits or by a relatively rapid scan rate cyclic potentiodynamic polarization (CPP) test may not be sufficiently conservative2,3 and (2) the repassivation potential measured on deep pits may be too low and, therefore, unnecessarily conservative for predicting the occurrence of localized corrosion.},

  abstract     = {The interaction of CO 2-rich waters with basaltic glass was studied experimentally and using reaction path and kinetic modeling in order to improve our understanding on the integrated effects of temperature, acid supply and reaction progress on the fluid composition, secondary mineralogy and mass of CO 2 mineralization during progressive water-rock interaction. Hydrothermal batch type experiments were carried out at 75, 150 and 250°C and {\~{}}80 to 270mmol/kg initial dissolved CO 2 concentrations. At 75°C, the pH was buffered at {\~{}}4.5 with Ca, Mg, Fe and Si being incorporated into Ca-Mg-Fe carbonates and chalcedony. At 150 and 250°C, the pH increased from {\~{}}5.5 to {\textgreater}6 with Ca being incorporated into calcite and Mg, Fe, Al and Si into smectites and/or chlorite depending on temperature. Comparison between the experimental results and the reaction path models indicated that the basalt alteration and sequestration of CO 2 depend on temperature. The mineralization of chalcedony at 75°C inhibited the formation of clays resulting in Ca, Mg and Fe being available for carbonate mineralization. At 150 and 250°C, Mg and Fe were predominantly incorporated into clays limiting the availability of Mg and Fe, resulting in calcite being the only carbonate forming. Comparison of the reaction path model with kinetic simulations yielded a similar modeled secondary mineralogy, and additionally showed that the transition of the formation of Ca-Mg-Fe carbonates at {\textless}150°C to calcite at {\textless}150°C was not solely related to temperature dependent mineral properties, but also related to the faster reaction kinetics observed at {\textless}150°C. This was especially reflected in the basaltic glass and smectite reaction rates. According to mass balance calculations using the reaction path simulations, the maximum amount of CO 2 mineralized was reached at 75°C and pH of {\~{}}5.5, indicating that CO 2 sequestration is favorable at {\textless}100°C. The experimental results and geochemical models were compared with data on natural waters and suggest that during progressive CO 2-water-basalt interaction, the water composition and reaction stoichiometry were closely reproduced by mineral-solution equilibria at 75 to 250°C and were controlled by temperature, pH and reaction progress. In turn, the pH was determined by the input of CO 2 and amount of basalt dissolution. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

One important factor which influences this technology is the activity of methanogenic microorganisms capable of utilising hydrogen and carbon dioxide for metabolism and leading to a change in the stored gas composition. A coupled, pore-scale model is presented which aids in the investigation of the mechanisms that govern the conversion of hydrogen to methane, i.e. advective hydrogen flow, its diffusion into microbial biofilms of multiple species, and its consumption within these biofilms. The model assumes that spherical grains are coated by a film of residual water and treats the biofilm development within each film in a quasi one-dimensional manner. A sample simulation using the presented model illustrates the biofilm growth process in these films as well as the competition between three different microbial species: methanogens, acetogens, and acetotrophs. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract     = {Flow through fractures is often idealized as flow between two parallel plates (plane Poiseuille flow). The opening or aperture between parallel plates is unambiguous and its relation to flowrate is well known. However, fractures in rock have uneven walls and a variable aperture. A model for flow in a frac- ture is proposed wherein the fracture is represented by a set of parallel plate openings with different aper- tures. The model leads to a modified Poiseuille equation for flow which includes an aperture frequency distribution for the fracture. Any arbitrary aperture distribution can be used; in order to simplify compu- tation and demonstrate the properties of the model a log normal form of distribution is assumed. Even when an analytical form of the distribution is assumed, two parameters, rather than a single value repre- senting 'aperture size' are required to determine flowrate. Models of aperture change for a fracture un- dergoing compression (fracture walls deforming) and extension (fracture walls separating) are developed which constrain the additional parameter and allow calculation of flowrate as a function of mean aper- ture. The theoretical relationships developed between mean aperture and flowrate can be used to inter- pret published laboratory data for single fractures},

It addresses the increasing use of digital computers for equilibrium calculations in high temperature, high pressure processes, in rocketry and in explosives technology. It surveys the numerical techniques developed over the fifteen to twenty years preceding its publication. The authors derive the equations describing equilibria in different types of system and outline the effect of variation of the parameters of the system on the equilibrium composition. They discuss critically the available methods of solution of the chemical equilibrium problem, both in the minimization and non-linear equations form, and indicate the factors that should be taken into account in selecting the optimum method of solution for a particular problem and computer. The fundamental chemical and thermodynamic analytic material was selected so as to make the book fully accessible for students of chemical engineering, explosives and technology.}

  abstract     = {Results of a laboratory study of internal corrosion in wet gas pipelines under conditions involving a stagnant or slowly flowing aqueous phase indicate that the corrosion rate is not affected by calcium and magnesium scale-forming tendency of the test solutions, provided that they are buffered. It is possible that the scales formed are sufficiently porous to permit electrolyte contact with steel. However, an increase in pH and decrease in oxygen resulted in significant corrosion rate reduction. Thermodynamic analyses indicate that the formation ofmetastable iron sulfide (FeS) precipitates is promoted by higher pH and higher dissolved iron concentration, and hindered by the presence of carbon dioxide (COJ. The presence of oxygen on corrosion may lead to the transformation of a metastable FeS phase, mackinawite (FeltxS), to another metastable phase, greigite (Fe3SJ. Electrochemical polarization data indicate that the steel behaves in an active manner symptomatic of a nonprotective corrosion product film. .The effect of 'oxygen in increasing the corrosion rate may be related to the increase in corrosion potential. Surface analysis by Raman spectroscopy confirmed some of the thermodynamic predictions of stable phases. Additionally, Raman spectroscopy indicated the predominance ofakaganeite (-) and repidocrocite (y-FeOOH). Based on the results of this study, a regression equation developed from nonscale-forming solutions may be adopted for predicting the internal corrosion of gas transmission and gathering lines caused by condensed water and acid gases. {\textcopyright} 2001, NACE International.},

  abstract     = {CPG (CO2 Plume Geothermal) energy systems use CO2 to extract thermal energy from naturally permeable geologic formations at depth. CO2 has advantages over brine: high mobility, low solubility of amorphous silica, and higher density sensitivity to temperature. The density of CO2 changes substantially between geothermal reservoir and surface plant, resulting in a buoyancy-driven convective current - a thermosiphon - that reduces or eliminates pumping requirements. We estimated and compared the strength of this thermosiphon for CO2 and for 20 weight percent NaCl brine for reservoir depths up to 5km and geothermal gradients of 20, 35, and 50??C/km. We found that through the reservoir, CO2 has a pressure drop approximately 3-12 times less than brine at the same mass flowrate, making the CO2 thermosiphon sufficient to produce power using reservoirs as shallow as 0.5 km. At 2.5 km depth with a 35??C/km gradient - the approximate western U.S. continental mean - the CO2 thermosiphon converted approximately 10{\%} of the energy extracted from the reservoir to fluid circulation, compared to less than 1{\%} with brine, where additional mechanical pumping is necessary. We found CO2 is a particularly advantageous working fluid at depths between 0.5 km and 3 km. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract     = {One natural retardation process to be considered in risk assessment for contaminants in the environment is sorption on mineral surfaces. A realistic geochemical modeling is of high relevance in many application areas such as groundwater protection, environmental remediation, or disposal of hazardous waste. Most often concepts with constant distribution coefficients (Kd-values) are applied in geochemical modeling with the advantage to be simple and computationally fast, but not reflecting changes in geochemical conditions. In this paper, we describe an innovative and efficient method, where the smart Kd-concept, a mechanistic approach mainly based on surface complexation modeling, is used (and modified for complex geochemical models) to calculate and apply realistic distribution coefficients. Using the geochemical speciation code PHREEQC, multidimensional smart Kd-matrices are computed as a function of varying (or uncertain) environmental conditions. On the one hand, sensitivity and uncertainty statements for the distribution coefficients can be derived. On the other hand, smart Kd-matrices can be used in reactive transport (or migration) codes (not shown here). This strategy has various benefits: (1) rapid computation of Kd-values for large numbers of environmental parameter combinations; (2) variable geochemistry is taken into account more realistically; (3) efficiency in computing time is ensured, and (4) uncertainty and sensitivity analysis are accessible. Results are presented exemplarily for the sorption of uranium(VI) onto a natural sandy aquifer material and are compared to results based on the conventional Kd-concept. In general, the sorption behavior of U(VI) in dependence of changing geochemical conditions is described quite well.},

The use of compacted swelling clays as engineered barriers is also considered within the framework of the multi-barrier concept. In relation to these concepts, various research programs have been conducted to assess the thermo-hydro-mechanical properties of radioactive waste disposal at great depth. After introducing the concepts of waste isolation developed in Belgium, France and Switzerland, the paper describes the retention and transfer properties of engineered barriers made up of compacted swelling clays in relation to microstructure features. Some features of the thermo-mechanical behaviors of three possible geological barriers, namely Boom clay (Belgium), Callovo-Oxfordian clay (France) and Opalinus clay (Switzerland), are then described, including the retention and transfer properties, volume change behavior, shear strength and thermal aspects.},

  abstract     = {To investigate CO2 Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) in sandstones, we performed three 150°C flow-through experiments on K-feldspar-rich cores from the Eau Claire formation. By characterizing fluid and solid samples from these experiments using a suite of analytical techniques, we explored the coupled evolution of fluid chemistry, mineral reaction rates, and hydrogeochemical properties during CO2 sequestration in feldspar-rich sandstone. Overall, our results confirm predictions that the heightened acidity resulting from supercritical CO2 injection into feldspar-rich sandstone will dissolve primary feldspars and precipitate secondary aluminum minerals. A core through which CO2-rich deionized water was recycled for 52days decreased in bulk permeability, exhibited generally low porosity associated with high surface area in post-experiment core sub-samples, and produced an Al hydroxide secondary mineral, such as boehmite. However, two samples subjected to ∼3day single-pass experiments run with CO2-rich, 0.94mol/kg NaCl brines decreased in bulk permeability, showed generally elevated porosity associated with elevated surface area in post-experiment core sub-samples, and produced a phase with kaolinite-like stoichiometry. CO2-induced metal mobilization during the experiments was relatively minor and likely related to Ca mineral dissolution. Based on the relatively rapid approach to equilibrium, the relatively slow near-equilibrium reaction rates, and the minor magnitudes of permeability changes in these experiments, we conclude that CCUS systems with projected lifetimes of several decades are geochemically feasible in the feldspar-rich sandstone end-member examined here. Additionally, the observation that K-feldspar dissolution rates calculated from our whole-rock experiments are in good agreement with literature parameterizations suggests that the latter can be utilized to model CCUS in K-feldspar-rich sandstone. Finally, by performing a number of reactive transport modeling experiments to explore processes occurring during the flow-through experiments, we have found that the overall progress of feldspar hydrolysis is negligibly affected by quartz dissolution, but significantly impacted by the rates of secondary mineral precipitation and their effect on feldspar saturation state. The observations produced here are critical to the development of models of CCUS operations, yet more work, particularly in the quantification of coupled dissolution and precipitation processes, will be required in order to produce models that can accurately predict the behavior of these systems.}

  abstract     = {Water chemistry has been shown experimentally to affect the stability of water films and the sorption of organic oil components on mineral surfaces. When oil is displaced by water, water chemistry has been shown to impact oil recovery. At least two mechanisms could account for these effects, the water chemistry could change the charge on the rock surface and affect the rock wettability, and/or changes in the water chemistry could dissolve rock minerals and affect the rock wettability. The explanations need not be the same for oil displacement of water as for water imbibition and displacement of oil. This article investigates how water chemistry affects surface charge and rock dissolution in a pure calcium carbon-ate rock similar to the Stevns Klint chalk by constructing and applying a chemical model that couples bulk aqueous and surface chemistry and also addresses mineral precipitation and dissolution. We perform calculations for seawater and formation water for temperatures between 70 and 130 • C . The model we construct accurately predicts the surface potential of calcite and the adsorption of sulfate ions from the pore water. The surface potential changes are not able to explain the observed changes in oil recovery caused by changes in pore water chemistry or temperature. On the other hand, chemical dissolution of calcite has the experimentally observed chemical and temperature dependence and could account for the experimental recovery systematics. Based on this preliminary analysis, we conclude that although surface potential may explain some aspects of the existing spontaneous imbibitions data set, mineral dissolution appears to be the controlling factor.},

These organic electrolytes exhibit very different solution nonideality from typical aqueous electrolytes with elemental ions. The proposed extension is an integration of the electrolyte NRTL model for aqueous electrolytes and the polymer NRTL model (Chen, 1993) for oligomers and polymers. Organic ions are treated as oligomers that consist of hydrocarbon segments and ionic segments that each exhibit distinctive physical interactions with neighboring species. This integrated NRTL model captures the nonideal phase behavior of aqueous organic electrolytes, including micelle formation. The model further provides a versatile thermodynamic framework to correlate solution nonideality of electrolyte systems, organic or inorganic, and complex systems containing both electrolytes and polymers.},

Flame 17:237-241 (1971)], a thermochemistry algorithm for characterizing partially equilibrated reacting systems is developed that, given the identity of the equilibrated reactions, determines (regardless of any linear dependencies among the reactions) a reduced reaction mechanism for the system, identifies the constraints and their dependence on this mechanism, and determines the thermodynamic state of the system by minimizing its free energy subject to instantaneous values of the constraints. This algorithm can be combined with any routine integrating the governing equations of the given system to construct programs capable of simulating the evolution of the system using fully rate controlled, partially equilibrated, or fully equilibrated chemistry as required. This is illustrated here by combining this algorithm with an ordinary differential equation solver and using the resulting one-dimensional flow program to predict the quenching of CO in cooled combustion streams, using partial equilibrium chemistry.},

  abstract     = {Hydrothermal flow experiments of single-pass injection of CO{\$}{\_}2{\$}-charged brine were conducted on nine dolomite cores to examine fluid-rock reactions in dolomite reservoirs under geologic carbon sequestration conditions. Post-experimental X-ray computed tomography (XRCT) analysis illustrates a range of dissolution patterns, and significant increases in core bulk permeability were measured as the dolomite dissolved. Outflow fluids were below dolomite saturation, and cation concentrations decreased with time due to reductions in reactive surface area with reaction progress. To determine changes in reactive surface area, we employ a power-law relationship between reactive surface area and porosity (Luquot and Gouze, 2009). The exponent in this relationship is interpreted to be a geometrical parameter that controls the degree of surface area change per change in core porosity. Combined with XRCT reconstructions of dissolution patterns, we demonstrate that this exponent is inversely related to both the flow path diameter and tortuosity of the dissolution channel. Even though XRCT reconstructions illustrate dissolution at selected regions within each core, relatively high Ba and Mn recoveries in fluid samples suggest that dissolution occurred along the core's entire length and width. Analysis of porosity-permeability data indicates an increase in the rate of permeability enhancement per increase in porosity with reaction progress as dissolution channels lengthen along the core. Finally, we incorporate the surface area-porosity model of Luquot and Gouze (2009) with our experimentally fit parameters into TOUGHREACT to simulate experimental observations. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

We investigate the use of a data-driven surrogate model in place of a geochemical simulation model to speed up the run-times of reactive transport simulations. This is a challenge because the surrogate model needs to use results of its predictions as inputs at each subsequent simulation step. We test the suitability of surrogate model approach on a popular reactive transport benchmark problem, often used for evaluating simulation models. We show that the concept is feasible and can make the simulations many times faster, however several open areas for future work remain.},

  abstract     = {Phase equilibria in mixtures containing carbon dioxide, water, and chloride salts have been investigated using a combination of solubility measurements and thermodynamic modeling. The solubility of water in the CO 2-rich phase of ternary mixtures of CO 2, H 2O and NaCl or CaCl 2 was determined, using near infrared spectroscopy, at 90atm and 40 to 100°C. These measurements fill a gap in the experimental database for CO 2-water-salt systems, for which phase composition data have been available only for the H 2O-rich phases. A thermodynamic model for CO 2-water-salt systems has been constructed on the basis of the previously developed Mixed-Solvent Electrolyte (MSE) framework, which is capable of modeling aqueous solutions over broad ranges of temperature and pressure, is valid to high electrolyte concentrations, treats mixed-phase systems (with both scCO 2 and water present) and can predict the thermodynamic properties of dry and partially water-saturated supercritical CO 2 over broad ranges of temperature and pressure. Within the MSE framework the standard-state properties are calculated from the Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers equation of state whereas the excess Gibbs energy includes a long-range electrostatic interaction term expressed by a Pitzer-Debye-H{\"{u}}ckel equation, a virial coefficient-type term for interactions between ions and a short-range term for interactions involving neutral molecules. The parameters of the MSE model have been evaluated using literature data for both the H 2O-rich and CO 2-rich phases in the CO 2-H 2O binary and for the H 2O-rich phase in the CO 2-H 2O-NaCl/KCl/CaCl 2/MgCl 2 ternary and multicompontent systems. The model accurately represents the properties of these systems at temperatures from 0°C to 300°C and pressures up to {\~{}}4000atm. Further, the solubilities of H 2O in CO 2-rich phases that are predicted by the model are in agreement with the new measurements for the CO 2-H 2O-NaCl and CO 2-H 2O-CaCl 2 systems even though the new data were not used in the parameterization of the model. Thus, the model can be used to predict the effect of various salts on the water content and water activity in CO 2-rich phases on the basis of parameters determined from the properties of aqueous systems. Given the importance of water activity in CO 2-rich phases for mineral reactivity, the model can be used as a foundation for predicting mineral transformations across the entire CO 2/H 2O composition range from aqueous solution to anhydrous scCO 2. An example application using the model is presented which involves the transformation of forsterite to nesquehonite as a function of temperature and water content in the CO 2-rich phase. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract     = {A method was developed for construction of stability diagrams for metals in the presence of realistically modeled aqueous solutions. The method was based on a comprehensive thermodynamic model that combines the Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers (HKF) equation of state for standard-state properties with a solution nonideality model based on the activity coefficient expressions developed by Bromley and Pitzer. Composition-dependent nonideality effects were incorporated into the calculation of predominance areas for dissolved and solid species. Using the combined thermodynamic model, stability diagrams can be computed for systems involving concentrated solutions (i.e., with molalities up to 30 mol/kg) at temperatures up to 573 K and pressures up to 100 MPa. Since the diagrams are based on a realistic thermodynamic model for the aqueous phase, they are referred to as real-solution stability diagrams. In addition to customary potential (E) and pH variables, concentrations of various active species (e.g., complexing agents) can be used as independent variables, making it possible to analyze effects of various compounds that promote or inhibit corrosion. Usefulness of the methodology was demonstrated by generating real-solution stability diagrams for five representative systems (i.e., sulfur-water [S-H2O], copper-ammonia-water [Cu-NH3-H2O], titanium-chlorine-calcium-water [Ti-Cl-Ca-H2O], iron-sulfur-water (Fe-S-H2O], and zinc-water [Zn-H2O]).},

  abstract     = {Renal, liver, heart and lung transplantation are now considered to be the standard therapeutic interventions in patients with end-stage organ failure. Infectious complications following solid organ transplantation (SOT) are relatively common owing to the transplant recipient's overall immunosuppressed status. The incidence of invasive mycoses following SOT ranges from 5{\%} to 42{\%} depending on the organ transplanted. Moreover, invasive fungal infections (IFIs) account for significant morbidity and mortality in SOT, ranging between 25{\%} and 95{\%} depending on the type of fungus and its organ localisation. The frequency, incidence and clinicoepidemiological characteristics of IFIs in patients who are recipients of non-pulmonary solid organ transplantation (NP-SOT) are very different from those that occur in patients with lung transplantation and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Candida and Aspergillus spp. are the cause of most infections. These fungal infections are associated with high overall mortality rates. Different strategies (prophylaxis, pre-emptive treatment, empirical therapy, antifungal combinations, routes of administration) have been tested to improve the prognosis of these invasive mycoses in SOT. To achieve this objective it is essential to have new antifungal drugs with a higher spectrum of activity against the fungal pathogens, both classical and emerging, and showing improvements in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, ease of administration and acceptability, and lower rates of adverse effects. This article will review the risk factors for IFIs in NP-SOT recipients and the available antifungal strategies for management. In addition, it will evaluate the role of prophylactic therapy in this group of patients.},

These calculations are performed at least once per mesh cell and once per time step, amounting to billions of them throughout the simulation employing high-resolution meshes. To radically reduce the computing cost of chemical equilibrium calculations (each requiring an iterative solution of a system of nonlinear equations), we consider an on-demand machine learning algorithm that enables quick and accurate prediction of new chemical equilibrium states using the results of previously solved chemical equilibrium problems within the same reactive transport simulation. The training operations occur on-demand, rather than before the start of the simulation when it is not clear how many training points are needed to accurately and reliably predict all possible chemical conditions that may occur during the simulation. Each on-demand training operation consists of fully solving the equilibrium problem and storing some key information about the just computed chemical equilibrium state (which is used subsequently to rapidly predict similar states whenever possible). We study the performance of the on-demand learning algorithm, which is mass conservative by construction, by applying it to a reactive transport modeling example and achieve a speed-up of one or two orders of magnitude (depending on the activity model used). The implementation and numerical tests are carried out in Reaktoro (reaktoro.org), a unified open-source framework for modeling chemically reactive systems.},

  abstract     = {Changes of porosity, permeability, and tortuosity due to physical and geochemical processes are of vital importance for a variety of hydrogeological systems, including passive treatment facilities for contaminated groundwater, engineered barrier systems (EBS), and host rocks for high-level nuclear waste (HLW) repositories. Due to the nonlinear nature and chemical complexity of the problem, in most cases, it is impossible to verify reactive transport codes analytically, and code intercomparisons are the most suitable method to assess code capabilities and model performance. This paper summarizes model intercomparisons for six hypothetical scenarios with generally increasing geochemical or physical complexity using the reactive transport codes CrunchFlow, HP1, MIN3P, PFlotran, and TOUGHREACT. Benchmark problems include the enhancement of porosity and permeability through mineral dissolution, as well as near complete clogging due to localized mineral precipitation, leading to reduction of permeability and tortuosity. Processes considered in the benchmark simulations are advective-dispersive transport in saturated media, kinetically controlled mineral dissolutionprecipitation, and aqueous complexation. Porosity changes are induced by mineral dissolution-precipitation reactions, and the Carman-Kozeny relationship is used to describe changes in permeability as a function of porosity. Archie's law is used to update the tortuosity and the pore diffusion coefficient as a function of porosity. Results demonstrate that, generally, good agreement is reached amongst the computer models despite significant differences in model formulations. Some differences are observed, in particular for the more complex scenarios involving clogging; however, these differences do not affect the interpretation of system behavior and evolution.},

  abstract     = {A comprehensive model has been developed for simulating the rates of general corrosion of selected metals in aqueous solutions. The model consists of a thermophysical and an electrochemical module. The thermophysical module is used to calculate the speciation of aqueous solutions and to obtain concentrations, activities, and transport properties of individual species. The electrochemical module simulates partial oxidation and reduction processes on the surface of the metal. It is capable of reproducing the active-passive transition and the effect of solution species on passivity. The model has been implemented in a program that can be used to simulate the effects of conditions such as temperature, pressure, pH, component concentrations, and flow velocity on corrosion rates. Application examples are presented for carbon steel in aerated systems in the presence of selected inorganic inhibitors. Good agreement with experimental data was obtained. {\textcopyright} 2001, NAGE International.},

  abstract     = {Reliable assessment and prediction of contaminant fate and transport in the subsurface media requires close collaboration of specialists with expertise in different disciplines such as geology, hydraulics, chemistry, microbiology, environmental science, and mathematics. As the number of disciplines has increased and as each has become more complex and quantitative, the problem of integrating the knowledge and concepts of various specialists into a coherent overall interpretation has become progressively more difficult. To an increasing degree reactive transport simulation has emerged as an answer to this problem, and the reactive transport model has become a vehicle for integrating the inputs of specialists from a variety of backgrounds. Advances in computer hardware and software have led to remarkable increases in the number, variety, and complexity of the processes which can be represented in simulation. Thus the ideas and formulations of different specialists can be combined in a model to generate an overall result, usually a distribution of mass concentration in space and time, which can be compared with observed data to gain a better understanding of the physical, chemical and biological processes that affect contaminant transport and remediation. The growing power of reactive transport simulation to incorporate complex processes and their interactions, and to address such issues as uncertainty, has of course come at the expense of increasingly complex models. More sophisticated solution approaches have been required, the need for ancillary mathematical tools to process and evaluate the results has increased, and in general the potential for numerical difficulty and model misuse has grown. To become an effective and well-informed user of a reactive transport model, one needs to be familiar with the basic theories of flow, transport and geochemical processes, understand the principal ideas behind a particular numerical solution technique and its implications for field applications, and know the limitations and constraints of different numerical models. I am pleased to see that this book will allow the readers to fulfill some of the aforementioned needs. The book is a collection of self-contained papers by the developers of several state-of-the-art and widely used reactive transport models. Each paper describes the development history, mathematical background, numerical techniques, and application case studies of a particular model code. From the descriptions in these papers, the readers will gain useful information and insights to help them make decisions on the suitability of each model code for a particular application. The book will be an invaluable reference text for researchers and students interested in applying multicomponent and multiphase reactive transport modeling to a multitude of geological, hydrological and environmental problems, such as waste disposal, groundwater remediation, groundwater quality management, and carbon sequestration.},

This work introduces a method for characterizing the deflagration of energetic materials in a laboratory setting, using only 15–20 mg of energetic material. Temperature, energy release and emission signatures were measured and analyzed for the laser-induced deflagration of 8 different conventional military explosives. Graphite nanoparticles and micron-sized aluminum powder were added to the explosive compositions to investigate their effect on the emission signatures. A high-speed color camera recorded the deflagration events and was utilized as a full-color pyrometer to calculate the average temperatures and image hotspots; the temperatures maps were compared to those measured by conventional two-color pyrometry. The laboratory-scale method presented here can be applied to novel energetic materials under development that may be available only in limited quantities to evaluate their potential as propellants or reduced emission signature explosives prior to scale-up.},

  abstract     = {Realistic simulation of structurally complex reservoirs (SCR) is challenging in at least three ways: (1) geological structures must be represented and discretized accurately on vastly different length scales; (2) extreme ranges and discontinuous variations of material properties have to be associated with the discretized structures and accounted for in the computations; and (3) episodic, highly transient and often localized events such as well shut-in have to be resolved adequately within the overall production history, necessitating a highly adaptive resolution of time. To facilitate numerical experiments that elucidate the emergent properties, typical states and state transitions of SCRs, an application programmer interface (API) called complex systems modelling platform(CSMPþþ) has been engineered in ANSI/ISOCþþ. It implements a geome- try and process-basedSCRdecomposition in space and time, and uses an algebraic multigrid solver (SAMG) for the spatio-temporal integration of the governing partial differential equations. This paper describes a new SCR simulation workflow including a two-phase fluid flow model that is compared with ECLIPSE in a single-fracture flow simulation. Geologically realistic application examples are presented for incompressible 2-phase flow, compressible 3-phase flow, and pressure-diffusion in a sector-scale model of a structurally complex reservoir.}

It was carried out during Phase 1 of the Sachplan; starting in 2008, it was completed in 2009 with the implementation of the electronic versions of the PSI/Nagra TDB 12/07. The update is mainly based on the OECD NEA‚{\"{A}}{\^{o}}s book series on ‚{\"{A}}{\'{u}}Chemical Thermodynamics‚{\"{A}}{\`{u}} and has considered the volumes that appeared after publication of the Nagra/PSI TDB 01/01, namely the four volumes concerning the chemical thermodynamics of Ni, Se, Zr, and Th, as well as the update volume on U, Np, Pu, Am and Tc. In addition, thermochemical data for Si compounds and complexes have been the subject of a thorough in-house review. The present report is a supplement to the documentation of the Nagra/PSI TDB 01/01 and replaces the chapters on the data selection for U, Np, Pu, Am, Cm, Tc, Ni, Se, Zr, Th, and Si. All other data contained in the Nagra/PSI TDB 01/01 have been adopted without any change and are not further discussed. Thus, e.g., the data concerning Al, Eu, Pd and Sn that were the subject of extensive in-house reviews for the preparation of the Nagra/PSI TDB 01/01 remain unchanged. As in the NEA review volumes and the Nagra/PSI TDB 01/01, the specific ion interaction theory (SIT) was used to extrapolate experimental data to zero ionic strength. In the documentation of the Nagra/PSI TDB 01/01, however, the SIT coefficients were in most cases not explicitly reported. For the present update, special care was given to the description of how the relevant SIT coefficients were obtained and the selected values are all tabulated. For the application of SIT to environmental systems where the salinity is governed by NaCl, an estimation method was developed to fill the numerous gaps in the set of experimentally determined SIT coefficients in NaCl background media.},

  abstract     = {Abstract: It was previously documented that seawater was able to change the wettability of oil-saturated chalk toward more water-wet conditions and that enhanced spontaneous imbibition of water was observed. The efficiency of the imbibition process was improved by increasing the sulfate concentration in seawater. Both calcium and sulfate present in seawater are potential determining ions toward the chalk surface; it is therefore expected that both of the ions are involved in the wettability modifying process, and the symbiotic effects between the ions are studied in this paper with the aim of improving oil recovery from moderate water-wet chalk. Outcrop chalk samples were aged at 90 C in an acidic crude oil for at least 4 weeks. The concentration of Ca2+ was varied both in the imbibing seawater and in the initial brine. Chromatographic wettability tests showed that the initial wetting condition of the chalk was not significantly affected by changing the concentration of Ca2+ in the initial brine. Increased oil recovery by spontaneous imbibition was observed with increasing concentration of Ca2+ in the imbibing seawater or increasing concentration of Ca2+ in the initial brine. The imbibition increased as the temperature increased, but care must be taken to avoid precipitation of CaSO4(s) at high temperatures. The spontaneous imbibition tests confirmed that SO42- and Ca2+ played an important role in the wettability modifying process. A chemical mechanism for the wettability alteration was suggested to involve the coadsorption of SO42- and Ca2+ onto the chalk surface, which resulted in desorption of carboxylic material.},

  abstract     = {We present an overview of novel numerical methods for chemical equilibrium and kinetic calculations for complex non-ideal multiphase systems. The methods we present for equilibrium calculations are based either on Gibbs energy minimization (GEM) calculations or on solving the system of extended law of mass-action (xLMA) equations. In both methods, no a posteriori phase stability tests, and thus no tentative addition or removal of phases during or at the end of the calculations, are necessary. All potentially stable phases are considered from the beginning of the calculation, and stability indices are immediately available at the end of the computation to determine which phases are actually stable at equilibrium. Both GEM and xLMA equilibrium methods are tailored for computationally demanding applications that require many rapid local equilibrium calculations, such as reactive transport modeling. The numerical method for chemical kinetic calculations we present supports both closed and open systems, and it considers a partial equilibrium simplification for fast reactions. The method employs an implicit integration scheme that improves stability and speed when solving the often stiff differential equations in kinetic calculations. As such, it requires compositional derivatives of the reaction rates to assemble the Jacobian matrix of the resultant implicit algebraic equations that are solved at every time step. We present a detailed procedure to calculate these derivatives, and we show how the partial equilibrium assumption affects their computation. These numerical methods have been implemented in Reaktoro (reaktoro.org), an open-source software for modeling chemically reactive systems. We finish with a discussion on the comparison of these methods with others in the literature.},

Potential applications are to (1) adiabatic flash (Joule-Thomson expansion) calculations for nonreacting pure fluids and mixtures at fixed (H,P), where P is the pressure; and (2) adiabatic (flame-temperature) calculations at fixed (U,V) or (H,P), where V is the system volume. The details of the method are presented. The method is compared with existing related simulation methodologies for nonreacting systems, one of which addresses the problem involving fixing portions of U or of H, and one of which solves the problem at fixed H considered here by means of an indirect approach.

In particular, attention is focused on mixed-solvent electrolyte models, equations of state for high-temperature and supercritical electrolyte systems and transport property models for multicomponent, concentrated solutions. The models are analyzed with respect to their capability of computing thermodynamic and transport properties in wide ranges of conditions and composition (i.e. for aqueous or mixed-solvent, dilute or concentrated solutions). Various frameworks for the development of electrolyte models are discussed, i.e. models that treat electrolytes on a completely dissociated or undissociated basis and those that take into account the speciation of solutions. A new mixed-solvent electrolyte model is developed for the simultaneous calculation of speciation and phase equilibria. The role of speciation is discussed with respect to the representation of the thermodynamic properties of mixed-solvent electrolyte solutions and diffusion coefficients in aqueous systems. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract     = {Computational methods in chemical equilibrium thermodynamics have found numerous application areas in diverse fields such as metallurgy, petrochemistry, the pulp and paper industry, the study of advanced inorganic materials, environmental science and biochemistry. As many of the cases of interest are not actually in equilibrium, there is a need for methods that extend the application area of multiphase equilibrium solvers to non-equilibrium systems. Likewise there is a need for efficient handling of thermochemical systems that are described by parameters other than those most commonly associated with Gibbs energy, namely temperature, pressure and fixed elemental (and charge) balances. In the work computational methods and related theory are presented that can be used with a standard Gibbs energy minimiser to solve advanced thermochemical problems. The actual calculations have been performed using the ChemSheet software, but the presentation has aimed to be generic and applicable to other thermochemical codes that allow the user to define thermodynamic data and the stoichiometries of the constituent species in the system. The examples discussed include electrochemical Donnan equilibrium (particularly applied to aqueous pulp suspensions), surface and interfacial energies of liquid mixtures, systems affected by external magnetic fields and systems with time-dependent reaction extents and diffusion-constrained paraequilibrium. A number of practical applications have been achieved with the models that combine reaction kinetics with partial thermodynamic equilibrium calculation and ion exchange models based on Donnan equilibrium, that have both been applied with success in real-life industrial design and development work with multicomponent, multiphase systems. The method has been successfully applied to liquid surface energies of systems with multiple components and complex non-equilibrium data.},

  abstract     = {Calcite and barite are two of the most common scale minerals that occur in various geochemical and industrial processes. Their solubility predictions at extreme conditions (e.g., up to 250°C and 1500 bar) in the presence of mixed electrolytes are hindered by the lack of experimental data and thermodynamic model. In this study, calcite solubility in the presence of high Na2SO4 (i.e., 0.0407 m Na2SO4) and barite solubility in a synthetic brine at up to 250°C and 1500 bar were measured using our high-temperature high-pressure geothermal apparatus. Using this set of experimental data and other thermodynamic data from a thorough literature review, a comprehensive thermodynamic model was developed based on the Pitzer theory. In order to generate a set of Pitzer theory virial coefficients with reliable temperature and pressure dependencies which are applicable to a typical water system (i.e., Na-K-Mg-Ca-Ba-Sr-Cl-SO4-CO3-HCO3-CO2-H2O) that may occur in geochemical and industrial processes, we simultaneously fit all available mineral solubility, CO2 solubility, as well as solution density. With this model, calcite and barite solubilities can be accurately predicted under such extreme conditions in the presence of mixed electrolytes. Furthermore, the 95{\%} confidence intervals of the estimation errors for solution density predictions are within 4 × 10-4 g/cm3. The relative errors of CO2 solubility prediction are within 0.75{\%}. The estimation errors of the saturation index mean values for gypsum, anhydrite, and celestite are within ±0.1 and that for halite is within ±0.01, most of which are within experimental uncertainties.

In the infinite-dilution limit, the temperature dependence of ionic conductivities is calculated on the basis of the concept of structure-breaking and structure-making ions. At finite concentrations, the concentration dependence of conductivity is calculated from the dielectric continuum-based mean-spherical-approximation (MSA) theory for the unrestricted primitive model. The MSA theory has been extended to concentrated solutions by using effective ionic radii. A mixing rule has been developed to predict the conductivity of multicomponent systems from those of constituent binary cation-anion subsystems. The effects of complexation are taken into account through a comprehensive speciation model coupled with a technique for predicting the limiting conductivities of complex species from those of simple ions. The model reproduces the conductivity of aqueous systems ranging from dilute to concentrated solutions (up to 30 mol/kg) at temperatures up to 573 K with an accuracy that is sufficient for modeling industrially important systems. In particular, the conductivity of multicomponent systems can be accurately predicted using data for single-solute systems.},

One prominent structure that extended 350 m downwards from the vicinity of a flow inlet early in the injection and that appears to contain a major flow path was subjected to detailed investigation to establish its hydrogeologic nature and the mechanisms underpinning its inferred permeability enhancement. High-resolution mi- croseismic mapping techniques (i.e. multiplets and clustering) showed it to be a subvertical, NNW–SSE striking, fracture zone of width 10–20 m. The strike and scale of the structure identifies it as a member of a family of hydrothermally altered, cataclastic shear structures that constitute the primary permeable paths for fluid migration within the rock mass, both under ambient and forced fluid flow conditions. The microseismicity occurred on subvertical, small- scale fractures within the cataclastic shear zone whose azimuths scatter within 22◦ of parallel to the parent structure. Although the structure is likely to have been naturally permeable to some degree, its permeability appears to have been significantly enhanced as a consequence of the injection. The most likely mechanism of permeability enhancement, which is in accord with the strong preference for the microseismicity to grow downwards, involves strike-slip shearing, which produced the opening of vertical tubes at along-strike jogs in the fault (the so-called Hill mesh). Seismic moment release averaged over the structure suggests shear displacements of at least 0.3 mm occurred, which are sufficient to generate aperture changes that are hydraulically significant. The preponderance of discrete structures within the microseismic cloud after col- lapsing suggests that significant flow and permeability enhancement (i.e. stimulation) within the rock mass is largely confined to the interiors of shear zones that appear to have a spacing of approximately 100 m.},

  abstract     = {The stable computation of linearly constrained, multiphase, chemical equilibrium compositions is an important topic for a wide range of industrial and academic applications. Numerous computational methods have been developed to solve such problems which are, in general, susceptible to failure under certain conditions due to numerical stiffness. In this work, we present a Gibbs function continuation method for linearly constrained multiphase equilibrium calculations. The method converts the nonlinear Element Potential Equations - derived from the minimization of the mixture Gibbs free energy using the Lagrange multiplier technique - into an initial value problem which can be stably integrated through the use of a property of linear least squares solutions. The stability and convergence properties of the proposed method are derived and it is shown that the single phase method arises as a special case of the multiphase algorithm when only one phase is considered. Two test cases are presented to clarify and demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the method.},

  abstract     = {An approach is suggested for computation of complete or metastable equilibrium states in the multicomponent, multiphase, and multiaggregate systems with parameters of state other than fixed temperature T and pressure P. It consists in computation of a series of isobaric-isothermal equilibrium states by Gibbs energy minimization. Thus, the general problem of minimization of thermodynamic potentials other than Gibbs energy G(T,P) is reduced to a sequence of simpler problems of two- or three-criteria parametric minimization of either of five thermodynamic potentials [isochoric-isothermal or Helmholtz energy A(T,V); isochoric-isentropic or internal energy at isochoric conditions U(S,V); isobaric-isentropic or enthalpy H(P,S); negative entropy at isobaric conditions and fixed enthalpy −S(P,H); and negative entropy at isochoric conditions and fixed internal energy −S(V,U)]. The computational scheme is simple, efficient, and reliable, because in any case it uses the IPM (Interior Points Method) algorithm for searching minimum of the non-linear total Gibbs energy function whereby one- or two-sided restrictions may be imposed on some or all dependent components in the system (Karpov and others, 1997). The new approach provides a rigorous basis for the formulation and numerical solution of the problems of chemical mass transfer under factors of state other than isobaric-isothermal. The developed algorithms and their implementation in Selektor-C program package can be used in a wide variety of scientific and practical applications. The numerical tests and examples illustrate the new technique on a model of irreversible oil-water interaction in hydrocarbon reservoirs (system Ca-Mg-C-O-H).}

  abstract     = {A time-space continuum model for transport of hydrothermal fluids in porous media is presented which provides for simultaneous, reversible and irreversible chemical reactions involving liquids, gases and minerals. Homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions are incorporated in the model in a similar fashion through source/sink terms added to the continuity equation. The model provides for moving reaction fronts through surfaces of discontinuity across which occur jump discontinuities in the various field variables satisfying generalized Rankine-Hugoniot relations. Reversible reactions including aqueous complexing, oxidation-reduction reactions, mineral precipitation and dissolution reactions and adsorption are explicitly accounted for by imposing chemical equilibrium constraints in the form of mass action equations on the transport equations. This is facilitated by partitioning the reacting species into primary and secondary species corresponding to a particular representation of the stoichiometric reaction matrix referred to as the canonical representation. The transport equations for the primary species combined with homogeneous and heterogeneous equilibria result in a system of coupled, nonlinear algebraic/partial differential equations which completely describe the evolution of the system in time. Spatially separated phase assemblages are accommodated in the model by altering the set of independent variables across surfaces of discontinuity. Constitutive relations for the fluid flux corresponding to primary species are obtained describing transport of both neutral and charged species by advection, dispersion and diffusion. Numerical implementation of the transport equations is considered and both explicit and implicit finite difference algorithms are discussed. Analytical expressions for the change in porosity and permeability with time are obtained for an assemblage of minerals reacting reversibly with a hydrothermal fluid under quasi-steady state conditions. Fluid flow is described by Darcy's law employing a phenomenological expression relating permeability and porosity. Finally an expression for the local retardation factor of solute species is derived for the case of advective transport in a single spatial dimension which accounts for the effects of homogeneous and heterogeneous equilibria including adsorption on the rate of advance of a reaction front. The condition for the formation of shock waves is given.},

  abstract     = {A set of four reactive flow-through experiments at temperature T = 100????C and total pressure P = 12??MPa was performed in limestone reservoir samples. By using various ranging from 0.7 to 10??MPa, these experiments mimic mass transfers occurring (1) near the injection well, where the brine is almost saturated with CO2 (i.e. PCO2 ??? P), and (2) at increasing distances from the injection well, where the fluid displays lower values and higher divalent cation concentrations due rock dissolution along the fluid pathway. Results for PCO2 = 10??MPa show non-uniform dissolution features associated with transport-controlled mass transfer, while reaction-controlled uniform dissolution is observed for PCO2 = 2.5??MPa. The experiment with PCO2 = 6??MPa allows investigating in detail the transition from transport- to reaction-controlled dissolution. Conversely, the experiment reproducing conditions far from the injection well (PCO2 = 0.7??MPa), shows a decrease of porosity triggered by the precipitation of Mg-rich calcite. For all the dissolution experiments, the time-resolved porosity ??{\{}symbol{\}}(t) can be modeled by a simple non-linear equation including parameters that characterise the dissolution regime triggered by the reactivity of the inlet fluid (measured by the Damk??hler number, Da). Furthermore, all dissolution experiments display power scaling between permeability (k) and porosity (??{\{}symbol{\}}) with distinctly different scaling exponents characterising the reactivity of the fluid percolating the sample, independently from the decrease with time of the reactive surface area. It is shown also that dissolution at moderate positive values of Da seems the most efficient to increase permeability and promote a rapid spreading of the reaction front, while inducing minimal modification of the porosity in the vicinity of the CO2 injection well. These results can be used to parameterize the k-??{\{}symbol{\}} function for modeling the earliest dissolution processes occurring in the vicinity of the reaction front. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {AbstractThis paper describes an implicit, three-dimensional formulation for simulating compositional-type reservoir problems. The model treats three-phase flow in Cartesian (x-y-z) or cylindrical (r-theta-z) geometries. Applicability ranges from depletion or cycling of volatile oil and gas condensate to miscible flooding operations involving either outright or multicontact-miscibility. The formulation uses an equation of state for phase equilibrium and property calculations. The equation of state provides consistency and smoothness as gas- and oil-phase compositions and properties converge near a critical point. This avoids computational problems near a critical point associated with use of different correlations for K values as opposed to phase densities. Computational testing with example multicontact-miscibility (MCM) problems indicates stable convergence of this formulation as phase properties converge at a critical point. Results for these MCM problems show significant numerical dispersion, primarily affecting the calculated velocity of the miscible-front advance. Our continuing effort is directed toward reduction of this numerical disperson and comparison of model results with laboratory experiments for both MCM and outright-miscibility cases. We feel that the implicit nature of the model enhances efficiency as well as reliability for most compositional-type problems. However, while we report detailed problem results and associated computing times, we lack simil},

From these analytical solutions, the operator-splitting methods are compared with respect to mass balance errors and convergence rates independently of the techniques used for solving each operator. Dimensionless times, NOS, are defined. They control mass balance errors and convergence rates. The following order in terms of decreasing efficiency is proposed: symmetric SI, Strang-splitting SNI, standard SNI, extrapolating SI and standard SI schemes. The symmetric SI scheme does not induce any operator-splitting errors, the Strang-splitting SNI appears to be O(N2OS) accurate, and the other schemes are first-order accurate.},

  abstract     = {Injection into geological formations is a technical option for decreasing carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere. Several key factors influence the performance and long-term integrity of injection into deep saline formations. Accurate representations of the physical properties of carbon dioxide have compiled and use to determine the theoretical storage density at typical sub-surface conditions, and the amount of energy that would be expended in injecting the carbon dioxide (whether pure or mixed with other gases), leading to an estimate of the net reduction of emissions. Detailed computer simulations indicate that the distribution of the injected carbon dioxide is initially dominated by gravity segregation, relative permeability effects and the permeability anisotropy of the saline formation. Post-injection, important effects occur which are not taken into account in conventional petroleum reservoir simulation. Convective mixing is predicted to occur, which greatly accelerates the dissolution of carbon dioxide in the saline formation water. This unusual phenomenon arises from the increase in the density of brine when saturated with carbon dioxide. Complete dissolution of the injected carbon dioxide is predicted to occur over hundreds to thousands of years, depending significantly on the vertical permeability of the formation and the geometry of the top seal. Reactions between the carbonated water and the formation also increase the rate of dissolution. If the chosen site is not a structural trap but a gently dipping regionally extensive formation, then the carbon dioxide can migrate up to tens of kilometres from the injection site, depending on the angle of dip and the horizontal permeability. However, convection and dissolution can still keep the carbon dioxide confined. This theoretical analysis has been developed as part of the Australian Petroleum CRC's GEODISC program, and is being used to assess the suitability of proposed sites for carbon dioxide sequestration. Introduction Projected emissions of “greenhouse gases”, principally carbon dioxide, are predicted to cause significant changes in average global temperature and sea-levels1, which could have negative consequences for people in many parts of the world. Scenarios for stabilising atmospheric carbon dioxide at reasonable levels will eventually require substantial cuts in overall emissions over the next few decades1,2. If usage of fossil fuels is to continue at current levels while avoiding undesirable climate change, technical means need to be found to reduce the carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere in the production and consumption of fossil fuels. One possible solution is to store or "sequester" CO2 emissions in a form where they will not reach the atmosphere. A large industrial source, such as a natural gas processing plant or power station, might produce 107 to 109 kg of CO2 per year over the operating life of the facility. The only disposal options that appear to have sufficient capacity are either the deep ocean or underground3. The latter option can encompass a variety of situations e.g. depleted oil and gas reservoirs, in which CO2 can be used for enhanced recovery, deep unmineable coal seams, where the CO2 can be stored while enhancing methane production, or deep saline formations. The latter option is particularly suitable in the Australian context, since sites with large sequestration capacity can be identified in most of Australia's petroliferous sedimentary basins4, and so the focus of this paper is on sequestration in deep saline formations.}

  abstract     = {In the tubular reactor models the mass and heat source terms due to chemical reactions in the species mass balances and temperature equation are conventionally determined from kinetic rate expressions. In many cases a kinetic rate model is not available but the chemical equilibrium conversion can be determined from reaction equilibrium calculations minimizing the Gibbs or Helmholtz free energies. Although a process is believed to behave physically like a tubular reactor, previous feasibility and design studies have typically disregarded fluid flow and mass- and heat transfer limitations and performed a classical chemical equilibrium calculation. For non-adiabatic cases, valuable information on the heat transfer flux limitations of the chemical process at the wall (often provided by a specified axial heating/cooling media temperature profile) is lost when simplifying a model representing the physical tubular reactor process behavior by considering a classical thermodynamic system having uniform state properties. For this reason, in the present study, a new type of tubular reactor model, which we name the differential Gibbs (or Helmholtz) reactor model, is presented to improve on the conventional feasibility and design model. In the differential Gibbs (or Helmholtz) reactor model, the chemical conversion and the reaction heat are determined assuming chemical reaction equilibrium conditions along the axial flow direction by minimizing the Gibbs (or Helmholtz) free energy. The new model is verified through comparison with the conventional differential tubular model using the fast reaction kinetics of the steam-methane reforming process and neglected mass diffusion limitation of the catalyst.},

  abstract     = {We performed core flooding experiments on Indiana limestone using the porous plate method to measure the amount of trapped CO(2) at a temperature of 50 °C and two pressures: 4.2 and 9 MPa. Brine was mixed with CO(2) for equilibration, then the mixture was circulated through a sacrificial core. Porosity and permeability tests conducted before and after 884 h of continuous core flooding confirmed negligible dissolution. A trapping curve for supercritical (sc)CO(2) in Indiana showing the relationship between the initial and residual CO(2) saturations was measured and compared with that of gaseous CO(2). The results were also compared with scCO(2) trapping in Berea sandstone at the same conditions. A scCO(2) residual trapping end point of 23.7{\%} was observed, indicating slightly less trapping of scCO(2) in Indiana carbonates than in Berea sandstone. There is less trapping for gaseous CO(2) (end point of 18.8{\%}). The system appears to be more water-wet under scCO(2) conditions, which is different from the trend observed in Berea; we hypothesize that this is due to the greater concentration of Ca(2+) in brine at higher pressure. Our work indicates that capillary trapping could contribute to the immobilization of CO(2) in carbonate aquifers.},

  abstract     = {A variety of flash specifications of practical importance can be formulated as minimization of a thermodynamic state function. It is well known that the solution for the PT-flash yields the global minimum of the mixture Gibbs energy, but in addition specifications of PH, PS, TV, UV or SV all permit selections of thermodynamic state functions for which a global minimum must be located. Two important advantages are obtained with the minimization based approach. First, the desired solution is known to be unique, and second, stability analysis can be used to verify its correctness and to determine the number of equilibrium phases. For the PT-flash the solution can be determined by unconstrained minimization, whereas the remaining specifications are accompanied by one or two nonlinear constraints and thus less straightforward to attack. We present here two approaches for dealing with such specifications. The first is a nested optimization approach where T and/or P are the dependent variables in the outer loop, and where a PT-flash is solved in the inner loop. The essential advantage of this formulation is that it is very easy to implement but the drawback is the additional cost of the nested loops. The second approach is based on a modified objective function in which all constraints are removed, but where a saddle point rather than a minimum must be located. The resulting equations are solved by a global Newton's method, and it is shown that a common Jacobian matrix can be used with all the specifications given above.},

  abstract     = {SummaryThe effects of transport and reaction on the phenomenon of wormhole formation were investigated for a wide range of fluid systems including strong acids, weak acids, and chelating agents. These fluid systems are influenced by a variety of transport and reaction processes such as the transport of reactants to the surface, the reversible surface reactions, and the transport of products away from the surface. When these transport and reaction processes are taken into account, a common dependence of the dissolution phenomenon on the Damko¨hler number is observed. There exists an optimum Damko¨hler number at which a minimum number of pore volumes are required for channel breakthrough. This optimum Damko¨hler number occurs at approximately 0.29 for all the fluid/mineral systems investigated in this study. In addition, an optimum kinetic parameter exists at which wormhole formation is most efficient. This optimum kinetic parameter occurs at a value of about 130. Together, the Damko¨hler number and the kinetic parameter provide a complete description of the dissolution phenomenon. IntroductionThe flow and reaction of reactive fluids in carbonate porous media results in the formation of highly conductive flow channels, commonly referred to as wormholes. These wormholes form because of rapid rates of dissolution and a large percentage of the mineral being dissolvable in the reactant. The structure of the wormhole channels is strongly dependent upon the rates of mass},

The OAPDs for correlative and predictive analyses of dielectric constants in binary solvents at a fixed temperature were 0.56 and 1.42{\%}, respectively. The corresponding values for binary solvents at different temperatures were 1.29 and 1.92{\%}, respectively.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a strategy to bypass the phase identification of fluid mixtures that can form three, or more, phases. The strategy is used for reservoir simulation of multicomponent, three-phase, thermal compositional displacement processes. Since the solution path in compositional space is determined by a limited number of “key” tie-simplexes, the proposed “bypass” method uses information from the parameterized tie-simplexes and their extensions. The tie-simplex parameterization is performed in the discrete phase-fraction space. Once the phase-fraction space is discretized, a conventional three-phase flash is used adaptively to compute the phase states at the discretization nodes. If all discretization vertices of a given discrete cell, in phase-fraction space, have the same phase state, then this state is assigned to the entire cell and expensive flash calculations are bypassed. We demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our phase identification bypassing strategy for several cases with three-phase flow, including a six-component ES-SAGD (enhanced solvent SAGD) model.},

Thermodynamic properties of intermediate and radical species are estimated by group additivity. Reactions for the decomposition and oxidation of TNT and its intermediate products are assembled, based on information from the literature and from analogous reactions where the rate constants are available. The resulting detailed reaction mechanism for TNT is added to existing reaction mechanisms for RDX and for hydrocarbons which can be produced from TNT and RDX. Properties of the reaction mechanism are demonstrated by examining problems of soot formation during open burning of TNT and mixtures of TNT and RDX. Computed results show how addition of oxygen to TNT can reduce the amounts of soot formed in its combustion and why RDX and most mixtures of RDX and TNT do not produce soot during their combustion or incineration. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Combustion Institute.

  abstract     = {Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) have the potential to make a significant contribution to the world energy inventory. One controversial issue associated with EGS, however, is the impact of induced seismicity or microseismicity, which has been the cause of delays and threatened cancellation of at least two EGS projects worldwide. Although microseismicity has in fact had few (or no) adverse physical effects on operations or on surrounding communities, there remains public concern over the amount and magnitude of the seismicity associated with current and future EGS operations. The primary objectives of this paper are to present an up-to-date review of what is already known about the seismicity induced during the creation and operation of EGS, and of the gaps in our knowledge that, once addressed, should lead to an improved understanding of the mechanisms generating the events. Several case histories also illustrate a number of technical and public acceptance issues. We conclude that EGS-induced seismicity need not pose a threat to the development of geothermal energy resources if site selection is carried out properly, community issues are handled adequately and operators understand the underlying mechanisms causing the events. Induced seismicity could indeed prove beneficial, in that it can be used to monitor the effectiveness of EGS operations and shed light on geothermal reservoir processes. ?? 2007 CNR.},

  abstract     = {Carbonate wettability is dictated by the surface chemistry related to stability of the water film between the oil phase and the rock surface. It has been verified, both in the field and laboratory, that seawater is an excellent injection fluid to enhance the oil recovery from fractured chalk. The objective of different papers in this series has been to understand the chemistry for improved spontaneous imbibition of seawater into low permeable chalk at low water wetness. Improved spontaneous imbibition of water will take place if the chalk becomes more water-wet during the production phase. The potential determining ions present in seawater, Ca2+ and SO4 2-, have great influence on the surface charge of chalk, which can modify the wettability during water injection. In the present study, it was verified that Mg2+ is another strong potential determining ion towards chalk, which can increase the positive surface charge density. At high temperatures, Mg2+ can even substitute Ca2+ from the chalk surface, and the degree of substitution increased as the temperature increased. The interplay between the three potential determining ions: Ca2+, Mg2+ and SO4 2- and the chalk surface with the aim to improve the water wetness of biogenic chalk, was studied from a spontaneous imbibition point of view. To improve water wetness, SO4 2- must act together with either Ca2+ or Mg2+. In both cases, the efficiency increased as the temperature increased. The water wetness of chalk can be improved if some of the carboxylic material adsorbed onto the chalk surface is displaced. A chemical mechanism discussing the mutual interaction between the potential determining ions and the chalk surface is proposed. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The presented Theriak/Domino software uses a unique algorithm of scanning and bookkeeping, which allows to compute completely and automatically a great variety of diagrams: phase diagrams, pseudo-binary, pseudo-ternary, isopleths, modal amounts, molar properties of single phases or bulk-rock properties like total DeltaG, volume of solids, etc. The speed and easiness of use makes thermodynamic modeling accessible to any student of Earth sciences and offers a powerful tool to check the consistency of thermodynamic databases, develop new solution models, plan experimental work, and to understand natural systems. The examples described in this paper demonstrate the capacity of the software, but also to show the usefulness and limitations of computed equilibrium assemblage diagrams. For most illustrations, a metapelite (TN205) from the eastern Lepontine Alps is used. The applications include the interpretation of complex diagrams, mineral reactions, the effect of Al content on the equilibrium assemblages, the interpretation of Si per formula unit in white mica, understanding some features of garnet growth, dehydration and isothermal compressibility, a broadening of the concept of AFM diagrams, combining equilibrium assemblage diagram information with thermobarometry, and comparing the results produced with different databases. Equilibrium assemblage diagrams do not always provide straightforward answers, but mostly stimulate further thought.},

The model incorporates a mixing rule for calculating the viscosity of solvent mixtures and a method for predicting the effect of finite electrolyte concentrations. The mixing rule represents the viscosity of multi-component solvent mixtures using molar volumes and viscosities of pure components together with binary parameters. With this mixing rule, the viscosity of ternary systems can be accurately predicted using parameters determined from only binary data. The effect of electrolyte concentration on viscosity is modeled by combining a long-range electrostatic term obtained from the Onsager-Fuoss theory, a contribution of individual ions, which is quantified by the Jones-Dole B coefficients, and a contribution of specific interactions between ions or neutral species. Formulations have been developed for the contributions of individual ions and species-species interactions to account for the effect of multiple solvents. In addition to solvent composition, the species-species interaction term is also a function of ionic strength. The model accurately reproduces the viscosity of systems such as salts in water, organic or mixed water-organic solvents and aqueous acids or bases up to the pure solute limit. The model has been coupled with thermodynamic equilibrium calculations to reproduce the effects of complexation or other ionic reactions on viscosity. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {UV-visible spectra for aqueous uracil and adenine were measured in a high-pressure platinum flow cell with sapphire windows at temperatures up to 250 oC at a constant pressure of 7.2 MPa. Ionization constants were determined from pH-dependent spectra in the buffer solutions NH3/NH4Cl, NaHCO3/Na2CO3, HCOOH/NaHCOO and NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4. Abstract Variations in the spectra with pH and temperature at constant flow rate were used to determine the first ionization constant of uracil, K1a (uracil), and the first and second acid ionization constants of adenine, K1a (adenine) and K2a (adenine), at ionic strength I = 0.2 mol kg-1 and temperatures up to 200 oC. Time-dependent spectra, obtained by operating the cell as a stopped flow reactor, were used to examine the rate of thermal decomposition as a function of temperature and pH from 200 to 250 oC. Reaction pathways and rate constants were determined by singular value decomposition methods. Uracil and adenine decomposition occurred by one-step and two-step processes, respectively. The kinetic results in the NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 buffer solution are in quantitative agreement with the less-extensive pioneering study by White (Nature 310, 430-432 (1984)), but differ from results in buffers that do not contain phosphate, suggesting that phosphate enhances the thermal stability of nucleic acid bases. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Numerous computational methods have been developed to solve such problems which are, in general, susceptible to failure under certain conditions due to numerical stiffness. In this work, we present a Gibbs function continuation method for linearly constrained multiphase equilibrium calculations. The method converts the nonlinear Element Potential Equations - derived from the minimization of the mixture Gibbs free energy using the Lagrange multiplier technique - into an initial value problem which can be stably integrated through the use of a property of linear least squares solutions. The stability and convergence properties of the proposed method are derived and it is shown that the single phase method arises as a special case of the multiphase algorithm when only one phase is considered. Two test cases are presented to clarify and demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the method.},

  abstract     = {Reactive mass transport (RMT) simulation is a powerful numerical tool to advance our understanding of complex geochemical processes and their feedbacks in relevant subsurface systems. Thermodynamic equilibrium defines the baseline for solubility, chemical kinetics, and RMT in general. Efficient RMT simulations can be based on the operator-splitting approach, where the solver of chemical equilibria is called by the mass transport part for each control volume whose composition, temperature, or pressure has changed. Modeling of complex natural systems requires consideration of multiphase–multicomponent geochemical models that include nonideal solutions (aqueous electrolytes, fluids, gases, solid solutions, and melts). Direct Gibbs energy minimization (GEM) methods have numerous advantages for the realistic geochemical modeling of such fluid–rock systems. Substantial improvements and extensions to the revised GEM interior point method algorithm based on Karpov's convex programming approach are described, as implemented in the GEMS3K C/C+ + code, which is also the numerical kernel of GEM-Selektor v.3 package (http://gems.web.psi.ch). GEMS3K is presented in the context of the essential criteria of chemical plausibility, robustness of results, mass balance accuracy, numerical stability, speed, and portability to high-performance computing systems. The stand-alone GEMS3K code can treat very complex chemical systems with many nonideal solution phases accurately. It is fast, delivering chemically plausible and accurate results with the same or better mass balance precision as that of conventional speciation codes. GEMS3K is already used in several coupled RMT codes (e.g., OpenGeoSys-GEMS) capable of high-performance computing.},

These topics include mathematical analyses and techniques for obtaining chemical equilibrium; formulas for obtaining thermodynamic and transport mixture properties and thermodynamic derivatives; criteria for inclusion of condensed phases; calculations at a triple point; inclusion of ionized species; and various applications, such as constant-pressure or constantvolume combustion, rocket performance based on either a finite or infinitechamberarea model, shock wave calculations, and ChapmanJouguet detonations. The second purpose of this report, to facilitate the use of the computer code, is accomplished in part II, entitled "Users Manual and Program Description."

A thermodynamic model describing the operational conditions for the optimal power density and the extraction of energy from a single-stage PRO process is introduced. The discharge behaviour of the power generated from the process is analysed and the profiles of water flux, power density, and extracted energy are obtained. The membrane consumption is also studied with respect to different hydraulic pressures on the draw solution, and the flows of both the draw and feed solutions. The inherent inconsistencies in the operational conditions with regard to achieving maximal power density and available energy is discussed and interpreted based on the discharge behaviour. A two-stage PRO process with two alternative feed arrangements (continuous feed and divided feed) is then proposed and its operations are simulated and analysed. The results indicate favourable energetic performance of the two-stage versus the one-stage PRO process in terms of the reduced frictional loss and unused energy involved in the process. ?? 2014.},

  abstract     = {A new approach for the implementation of interior-point methods for solving linear programs is proposed. Its main feature is the iterative solution of the symmetric, but highly indefinite 2 X 2-block systems of linear equations that arise within the interior-point algorithm. These linear systems are solved by a symmetric variant of the quasi-minimal residual (QMR) algorithm, which is an iterative solver for general linear systems. The symmetric QMR algorithm can be combined with indefinite preconditioners, which is crucial for the efficient solution of highly indefinite linear systems, yet it still fully exploits the symmetry of the linear systems to be solved. To support the use of the symmetric QMR iteration, a novel stable reduction of the original unsymmetric 3 × 3-block systems to symmetric 2 x 2-block systems is introduced, and a measure for a low relative accuracy for the solution of these linear systems within the interior-point algorithm is proposed. Some indefinite preconditioners are discussed. Finally, we report results of a few preliminary numerical experiments to illustrate the features of the new approach.},

  abstract     = {Extreme enrichment and postmagmatic hydrothermal mobilization of the rare earth elements (REE), Zr, and Nb have been reported for a number of anorogenic peralkaline intrusions, including the world-class REE-Zr-Nb deposit at Strange Lake, Quebec, Canada. Establishing lithogeochemical vectors for these types of deposits is a challenging task because the effects of hydrothermal processes on element distribution are poorly known and the relationships of alteration types to mineralization stages have not been well documented. Here, we present results of a detailed mineralogical and geochemical investigation involving a dataset of over 500 mineral and bulk-rock analyses of a northeast-southwest section through the potential ore zone at Strange Lake. Based on these data, we develop a model that explains the role of hydrothermal processes in concentrating metals in peralkaline granitic systems and identify lithogeochemical vectors for their exploration. The B zone, located along the northwestern margin of the Strange Lake pluton, contains a lens-shaped, pegmatite-rich domain comprising subhorizontal sheets of pegmatites hosted by granites with a total indicated resource of 278 million tonnes (Mt) grading 0.93 wt {\%} total rare earth oxides (TREO), of which 39{\%} are heavy rare earth elements (HREE). Within this resource, there is an enriched zone containing 20 Mt of ore grading 1.44 wt {\%} TREO, of which 50{\%} are HREE. The pegmatites are characterized by a core enriched in quartz, fluorite, and light rare earth elements (LREE) fluorocarbonates, and a granitic border enriched in zirconosilicates and granitic minerals. The pegmatite sheets and surrounding granites evolved in three essential stages: a magmatic stage (I), a near-neutral hydrothermal stage involving their interaction with NaCl-bearing orthomagmatic fluids (II), and an acidic hydrothermal stage (III, comprising high-[IIIa] and low-temperature [IIIb] substages) that resulted from their interaction with pegmatite-sourced HCl-HF–bearing fluids. Stage IIIa led to pseudomorphic mineral replacement reactions (e.g., Na-Ca exchange during replacement of zirconosilicates) and formation of an aegirinization/hematization halo around the pegmatites. In contrast, stage IIIb, which was responsible for the hydrothermal mobilization of Zr and REE, is manifested by fluorite and quartz veins, zircon spherules, gadolinite-group minerals, gittinsite, ferriallanite-(Ce), and a pervasive replacement of the granite by these minerals. The distribution of REE, Zr, Nb, and Ti was controlled by the competition between hydrothermal fluids and the stability of primary REE-F-(CO2) minerals (e.g., bastn{\"{a}}site-(Ce) host to LREE), zirconosilicates (i.e., Na zirconosilicates and zircon host to HREE and Zr), and Nb-Ti minerals (i.e., pyrochlore host to Nb and narsarsukite host to Ti), and the stability of secondary LREE silicates (i.e., ferriallanite-(Ce)), HREE silicates (i.e., gadolinite-(Y)), zirconosilicates (i.e., gittinsite and zircon), and Nb-Ti minerals (i.e., titanite and pyrochlore). Lithogeochemical vectors were identified to distinguish between the high-temperature acidic alteration (IIIa), using CaO/Na2O (indicator of Ca metasomatism) and Fe2O3/Na2O ratios (indicator of aegirinization/hematization), and the low-temperature acidic alteration (IIIb), using the CaO/Al2O3 ratio (indicator of Ca-F metasomatism). Bulk-rock compositional data show that alteration was accompanied by an enrichment in heavy rare earth oxides (HREO) and ZrO2 at the deposit scale, whereas there was no selective enrichment in the light rare earth oxides (LREO). A 2-D geochemical model of the deposit indicates that the LREO are more dispersed, whereas HREO and ZrO2 are selectively distributed. These variations in LREE/HREE are also reflected in the mineral chemistry, especially in hydrothermal zircon crystals showing an unusual LREE enrichment and HREE depletion, contrasting with pseudomorphs, which are enriched in HREE. Hydrothermal ferriallanite-(Ce) and gadolinite-group minerals also show a clear trend of REE depletion with Ca enrichment. Controlling factors for the hydrothermal mobilization of LREE, HREE, and Zr were temperature, pH, and the availability of fluoride ions (F−) in the fluid for the dissolution of zircon, and chloride ions (Cl−) for the complexation of the REE. The study of rare hydrothermal minerals in conjunction with field observations and the evaluation of variations in bulk-rock composition allowed us to develop a new model for the hydrothermal evolution stage of Strange Lake.}

This paper studies the effect of these forces using a new volume-of-fluid based finite volume method developed for simulating two-phase flow directly on micro-CT images of porous media. An analytical analysis of the relationship between the pore-scale forces and the Darcy-scale pressure drops is presented. We use this analysis to propose unambiguous definitions of Darcy-scale viscous pressure drops as the rate of energy dissipation per unit flow rate of each phase, and then use them to obtain the relative permeability curves. We show that this definition is consistent with conventional laboratory/field measurements by comparing our predictions with experimental relative permeability. We present single and two-phase flow simulations for primary oil injection followed by water injection on a sandpack and a Berea sandstone. The two-phase flow simulations are presented at different capillary numbers which cover the transition from capillary fingering at low capillary numbers to a more viscous fingering displacement pattern at higher capillary numbers, and the effect of capillary number on the relative permeability curves is investigated. Overall, this paper presents a new finite volume-based methodology for the detailed analysis of two-phase flow directly on micro-CT images of porous media and upscaling of the results to the Darcy scale.},

The modeling methodology calls for solving conservation equations to account for the interaction between mass-transfer and reaction processes using a sequential iteration numerical method.{\$}\backslash{\$}nThe formalism presented here improves upon the traditional approach by reformulating conservation equations to express chemical elemental mass evolution. The elemental conservation equations describe mass change through mass-transfer and kinetic reactions of solids, and solute-solute interaction (equilibrium) reaction expressions. The system of equations is solved using a sequential iteration method, whereby globally discretized mass-transfer coefficients of conservation equations are injected explicitly into the conservation equations and solved locally at each node. The result is a mathematically simple approach that eliminates the traditionally required use of primary and secondary species classification. The formalism also allows the use of solute-specific diffusivities. In addition, the tight coupling between mass-transfer and reactions achieved by the methodology also allows nonlinear self-organization or pattern-forming phenomena to be captured.{\$}\backslash{\$}nThe methodology is demonstrated with simulations of (1) a diffusive-reaction system involving patterned hematite nucleation, and (2) a flow-through system where CO{\$}{\_}2{\$}-charged water interacts with formation water in a sandstone reservoir. Both are isothermal one-dimensional simulations. In the first example, convergent diffusive infiltration of Fe++ and O2 from two opposite ends produces patterned precipitates. A natural analog of such phenomena is the occurrence of iron-oxide concretions in Navajo Sandstones of Utah and Arizona. The second example demonstrates the formation of a diffusive solute migration front ahead of advective effluent displacement and reaction fronts. Such phenomena are observed when large quantities of CO{\$}{\_}2{\$} are injected into geologic formations. The early arrival of diffusive solute fronts at nearby monitoring wells are noted by decreasing water pH and raised alkalinity some time before the arrival of the effluent.},

The electrochemical module includes the adsorption ofhalides, which strongly influences the corrosion process. Also, the model takes into account the formation ofpassive films and their interactions with solution species. The model has been verified by comparing calculated corrosion rates with laboratory data for carbon steels in LiBr solutions. Good agreement between calculated and experimental corrosion rates has been obtained. In particular, the model is capable of reproducing effects of pH-adjusting components and selected inhibitors on the rates of general corrosion.

  abstract     = {An algorithm for the construction of phase diagram sections is formulated that is well suited for geodynamic problems in which it is necessary to assess the influence of phase transitions on rock properties or the evolution and migration of fluids. The basis of the algorithm is the representation of the continuous compositional variations of solution phases by series of discrete compositions. As a consequence of this approximation the classical non-linear free energy minimization problem is trivially solved by linear programming. Phase relations are then mapped as a function of the variables of interest using bisection to locate phase boundaries. Treatment of isentropic and isothermal phase relations involving felsic and mafic silicate melts by this method is illustrated. To demonstrate the tractability of more complex problems involving mass transfer, a model for infiltration driven-decarbonation in subduction zones is evaluated. As concluded from earlier closed system models, the open-system model indicates that carbonates are likely to persist in the subducted oceanic crust beyond sub-arc depths even if the upper section of the oceanic mantle is extensively hydrated. However, in contrast to more simplistic models of slab devolatilization, the open-system model suggests slab fluid production is heterogeneous and ephemeral. Computed seismic velocity profiles, together with thermodynamic constraints, imply that for typical geothermal conditions serpentinization of the subducted mantle is unlikely to extend to {\textgreater} 25 km depth and that the average water-content of the serpentinized mantle is {\textless} 2 wt.{\%}. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {We present an open-source Thermochemical Equilibrium Abundances (TEA) code that calculates the abundances of gaseous molecular species. The code is based on the methodology of White et al. (1958) and Eriksson (1971). It applies Gibbs free-energy minimization using an iterative, Lagrangian optimization scheme. Given elemental abundances, TEA calculates molecular abundances for a particular temperature and pressure or a list of temperature-pressure pairs. We tested the code against the method of Burrows {\&} Sharp (1999), the free thermochemical equilibrium code CEA (Chemical Equilibrium with Applications), and the example given by White et al. (1958). Using their thermodynamic data, TEA reproduces their final abundances, but with higher precision. We also applied the TEA abundance calculations to models of several hot-Jupiter exoplanets, producing expected results. TEA is written in Python in a modular format. There is a start guide, a user manual, and a code document in addition to this theory paper. TEA is available under a reproducible-research, open-source license via https://github.com/dzesmin/TEA.},

The residual function, representing the distance to the equilibrium, is defined from the chemical potential (or Gibbs energy) of the chemical system. Local minimums are potentially avoided by the prioritization of the aqueous reactions with respect to the heterogeneous reactions. The formation and release of gas bubbles is taken into account in the model, limiting the concentration of volatile aqueous species to a maximum value, given by the gas solubility constant.The reaction extents are used as state variables for the numerical method.

The second is the prevention of convergence to trivial solutions in both the Gibbs free energy minimization problem for two-phase mixtures and the associated phase stability test for single-phase mixtures. The third is the use of effective convergence criteria to obtain either the desired level of accuracy in the solution or the maximum accuracy allowed by the problem and the computer. ?? 1987.},

Being aware of the invariance of the calculated vapor pressure, it was decided to investigate which properties among the enthalpy, the entropy, the internal energy, the heat capacities, the speed of sound, the property changes on vaporization and many others were altered by a volume translation. All these state functions are indeed volume-dependent and the influence of the translation on their values needs to be clarified.

The essence of the new CSP formulation is to take advantage of short species time-scales that can be analytically derived or efficiently evaluated through numerical computations. Complication induced by the presence of partial equilibrium reactions is discussed. It is shown that linear combi-nations of fast variables may result in slow modes. Special analytic treatments are proposed for the toy problems, and such treatments may be extended for general stiff chemistry in future study. This work demonstrates the possibility of efficient analytic or semianalytic approaches to enable on-the-fly chemical stiffness removal using CSP. In contrast, the previous CSP methods involve expensive eigen-compu-tation and are typically expensive for large-scale combustion simulations.},

  abstract     = {A chemical or biochemical reaction can drive an ion through a semipermeable membrane and set up an electric potential difference that can cause the transport of a different ion through the membrane against its concentration gradient. This article treats the thermodynamics of a system in which an ionic reaction A + B = C drives C through a membrane permeable only to C:. The fundamental equation for the Gibbs energy G leads to a criterion for spontaneous change and equilibrium involving the transferred charge Q as a natural variable. This leads to an extension of the membrane equilibrium equation. It is shown that the number D of natural variables is equal to the number f of independent intensive variables (degrees of freedom) plus the number of phases. Since the charge transferred is not a convenient natural variable from an experimental point of view, a Legendre transform is used to define a transformed Gibbs energy G' that has the potential difference between the phases as a natural variable. This leads to the transformed chemical potential mu(i)' that is related to the chemical potential by mu(i) = mu(i)' + Fz phi(i). Since the chemical potential, which has the same value in phases at equilibrium, is given by mu(i) = mu(i) degrees + RT In a(i)+ Fz phi(i), the transformed chemical potential for i in a multiphase system with potential differences is given by mu(i)' = mu i degrees + RT In a(i).},

The methodology combines two models, a grain boundary microchemistry model for calculating the chromium and molybdenum depletion profiles in the vicinity of grain boundaries and an electrochemical model that relates the repassivation potential to the microchemistry and environmental conditions, including temperature and solution chemistry. The grain boundary microchemistry model incorporates a thermodynamic paraequilibrium treatment of the formation of carbides and a kinetic treatment of the diffusion of Cr and Mo. With this model, experimental Cr and Mo depletion profiles can be reproduced for sensitised alloys 600, 825 and 316L. The repassivation potential model accounts for the effects of solution chemistry and temperature by considering competitive dissolution, adsorption and oxide formation processes at the interface between the metal and the occluded site solution. Using a previously developed relationship between the repassivation potential and bulk alloy composition, a procedure has been established for calculating the observable repassivation potential of thermally aged alloys by integrating the local E rp values that correspond to the alloy microchemistry in the depletion zone. The predicted repassivation potentials agree with experimental data for thermally aged alloys 600 and 825 in chloride solutions. Additionally, the model has been applied to estimate the repassivation potential of welded samples in which segregation of alloying elements is observed. {\textcopyright} 2010 Maney Publishing.},

The partial processes taken into account by the model include the oxidation of iron and reduction of hydrogen ions, water, carbonic acid and hydrogen sulfide. Also, the model includes the formation of iron carbonate and iron sulfide scales and their effect on the rate of general corrosion as a function of temperature and solution chemistry. The model has been verified by comparing calculated corrosion rates with laboratory data under conditions that may or may not be conducive to the formation of protective scales. Good agreement between the calculated and experimental corrosion rates has been obtained. The model has been incorporated into a program that makes it possible to analyze the effects of various conditions such as temperature, pressure, solution composition or flow velocity on corrosion rates.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear reactive transport problems can be solved using the Operator Splitting (OS) approach, where transport and reaction processes are separated or the Direct Substitution Approach (DSA) where chemical and transport equations are solved simultaneously. The OS techniques can be very attractive, but are known to introduce splitting errors with SNIA (Non Iterative OS) and have low convergence rate with SIA (Iterative OS). These problems are avoided with DSA which is more robust than OS schemes. On the other hand, DSA is more complicated and very demanding in terms of computing time and memory requirements. This can make DSA less efficient than OS schemes especially for fine discretizations and chemically simple problems. In this work, DSA, SIA and SNIA are combined with a new sparse direct (unifrontal/multifrontal) solver. The efficiency of this solver is not dependent on the matrix conditioning. The performance of the three approaches is studied for two transport problems with simple and difficult chemical reactions and for different number of unknowns. Results show that when combined with an efficient sparse direct solver, DSA is more efficient than SIA and SNIA even for chemically simple problems and large number of unknowns.},

The resulting universal quasi‐chemical (UNIQUAC) equation uses only two adjustable parameters per binary. Extension to multicomponent systems requires no ternary (or higher) parameters. The UNIQUAC equation gives good representation of both vapor‐liquid and liquid‐liquid equilibria for binary and multicomponent mixtures containing a variety of nonelectrolyte components such as hydrocarbons, ketones, esters, amines, alcohols, nitriles, etc., and water. When well‐defined simplifying assumptions are introduced into the generalized quasi‐chemical treatment, the UNIQUAC equation reduces to any one of several well‐known equations for the excess Gibbs energy, including the Wilson, Margules, van Laar, and NRTL equations. The effects of molecular size and shape are introduced through structural parameters obtained from pure‐component data and through use of Staverman's combinatorial entropy as a boundary condition for athermal mixtures. The UNIQUAC equation, therefore, is applicable also to polymer solutions. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1975 American Institute of Chemical Engineers},

For these components, the polar version of the PC-SAFT model requires four pure-component parameters as well as the functional-group dipole moment. For each binary system, only one temperature-independent binary interaction k ij is needed. Simple mixing and combining rules are adopted for mixtures with more than one polar component without using an additional binary interaction parameter. The ability of the model to accurately describe azeotropic and non-azeotropic vapor-liquid equilibria at low and at high pressures, as well as liquid-liquid equilibria is demonstrated for various systems containing polar components. Solvent systems like acetone-alkane mixtures and co-polymer systems like poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate)/solvent are discussed. The results for the low-molecular systems also show the predictive capabilities of the extended PC-SAFT model. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {Computation of chemical equilibria in multiphase systems by Gibbs free energy minimization under constraints set by the material balance has increasing interest in many application fields, including materials technology, metallurgy and chemical engineering. The results are utilised in multi-phase equilibrium studies or as parts of equilibrium-based process simulation. Yet, there exist a number of practical problems where the chemical system is influenced by other constraining factors such as surface energy or electrochemical charge transport. For such systems, an extended Gibbs energy method has been applied. In the new method, the potential energy is introduced to the Gibbs energy calculation as a Legendre transformed work term divided into substance specific contributions. The additional constraint potential is then represented by a supplementary undertermined Lagrange multiplier. In addition, upper bounds on the amounts of products can be set, which then limit the maximum extents of selected spontaneous chemical reactions in terms of affinity. The range of Gibbs energy calculations can then be extended to new intricate systems. Example models based on free energy minimisation have been made e.g. for surface and interfacial systems, where the surface, interfacial or adsorbed atomic or molecular layers are modeled as separate phases. In an analogous fashion the partitioning effect of a semi-permeable membrane in a two-compartment aqueous system can be modeled. In such system the large ions, not permeable through the membrane, cause an uneven charge distribution of ionic species between the two compartments. In this case, the electrochemical potential difference between the two aqueous phases becomes calculated for the multi-component system. The calculated results are consistent with the Donnan equilibrium theory; however the multi-phase system may also include the gas phase and several precipitating phases, which extends the applicability of the new method. Finally, similar constraints can also be set to extents of reaction advancements, allowing usage of Gibbs energy calculations in dynamic reaction rate controlled systems. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {The lteration of basaltic glass was studied experimentally at elevated CO 2 pressures ({\~{}}10-25bar) and hydrothermal conditions (75-250??C) to determine the effects of temperature and extent of reaction (??) on the secondary mineral formation and compositional evolution of alteration assemblages resulting from CO 2-water-basalt interaction. At {\textless}100??C, the alteration products consisted of concentric layers of ankerite and dolomite-ankerite solid solutions (Ca-Mg-Fe carbonates) and amorphous silica. At ???150??C, mixed Ca-Mg-Fe smectites and chlorite, calcite, amorphous silica and zeolites formed instead of Ca-Mg-Fe carbonates. Competing reactions between carbonates and clays for major divalent cations (Ca, Mg and Fe) were affected by the extent of reaction with smectites formed initially and progressively being replaced by calcite and chlorite. The basaltic glass dissolution rate and mechanism were also affected by temperature and reaction time. At lower temperatures (???150??C), a hydrated leached layer formed on the glass surface and the mass fluxes in the system were largely controlled by the dissolution rate and mechanism of the glass, whereas at higher temperature (250??C) the dissolution rate of the basaltic glass was fast with the reactions primarily driven by secondary mineral replacement and growth. We conclude that the driving force for carbonate mineralization in basaltic glass at elevated CO 2 conditions is linked to the geochemical behavior and mobility of Ca, Mg and Fe together with the availability of Si for Al-Si-mineral formation. At {\textless}100??C, the divalent cations are available for Ca-Mg-Fe carbonate formation, whereas at ???150??C abundant clays limit the availability of Mg and Fe resulting in calcite being the only carbonate formed. This implies a quantitatively more effective fixation of CO 2 at {\textless}100??C associated with the formation of Ca-Mg-Fe carbonates. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

These algorithms are based on the use of the elements balance approach where the mass balance equations and the Gibbs energy minimization problem are solved in terms of the elements balance variables and not in terms of component compositions. The total number of elements, which can be atoms, molecules or groups (radicals), is smaller than the number of components in the reactive system. The reduced number of variables allows the visualization of the phase diagrams for many multicomponent reactive systems in two- or three-dimensional figures. Element fractions which are by definition similar to the component mole fractions, are employed to determine the conditions for the existence of element azeotropes. These conditions are identical to those that apply for non-reactive (conventional) determination. Illustrative examples highlighting various features of the proposed algorithms are presented through four reactive systems.},

The key idea of the approach is the transformation of discretized mass- and energy-conservation equations to an operator form with separate space-dependent and statedependent components. The state-dependent operators are parameterized using a uniformly distributed mesh in parameter space. Multilinear interpolation is used during simulation for a continuous reconstruction of state-dependent operators that are used in the assembly of the Jacobian and residual of the nonlinear problem. This approach approximates exact physics of a simulation problem, which is similar to an approximate representation of space and time discretization performed in conventional simulation. Maintaining control of the error in approximate physics, we perform an adaptive parameterization to improve the performance and flexibility of the method. In addition, we extend the method to compositional problems with buoyancy. We demonstrate the robustness and convergence of the approach using problems of practical interest.},

The new method enables the association of the conservation matrix with structural, physical, chemical, and energetic properties, and thus the scope of free energy calculations can be extended beyond the conventional studies of global chemical equilibria and phase diagrams. The use of immaterial constraints enables thermochemical calculations in partial equilibrium systems as well as in systems controlled by work factors. In addition, they allow the introduction of mechanistic reaction kinetics to the Gibbsian multiphase analysis. The constrained advancements of reactions are incorporated into the Gibbs energy calculation by using additional virtual phases in the conservation matrix. The virtual components are then utilized to meet the incremental consumption of reactants or the formation of products in the kinetically slow reactions. The respective thermodynamic properties for the intermediate states can be used in reaction rate formulations, e.g., by applying the reaction quotients.},

Biochemical reactions at a specified pH satisfy conservation equations for elements in addition to hydrogen, but they often satisfy additional independent conservation equations because of the coupling of reactions through the enzymatic mechanism. The enzyme may couple together two or more biochemical reactions so that only the sum of the coupled reactions is catalysed. The biochemical reactions that are coupled together may, or may not, share reactants, but the type of coupling discussed here is stoichiometric. Since chemical equations and biochemical equations are mathematical equations, linear algebra provides the means for determining the number and types of constraints involved in the enzymatic mechanism. Constraints in addition to element balances indicate missing reactions. The identification of conservation equations is essential for calculations of equilibrium compositions using computer programs that minimize the transformed Gibbs energy at a specified pH subject to the conservation equations that apply. ?? 1994.},

On the basis of a numerical algorithm (EQS) to solve systems of simultaneous free energy equations, binding profiles of simple to highly complex interacting systems can be analyzed over any concentration region without any need to generate an analytical form to describe the data. The output of the numerical algorithm is the concentration of each individual species in solution, allowing the generation of all possible binding profiles of the system (e.g., protein saturation by ligand). We present here the application of this approach to the DNA-protein subunit-ligand interactions of the trp repressor system as a typical example. From a practical point of view, the analysis program is capable of the rapid and simultaneous analysis of multiple binding profiles in terms of internally consistent sets of free energies. Given both the enormous complexity, as well as the underlying subtlety, involved in the regulation of biological function, the present generalized approach to analyzing macro-molecular binding should find wide applications. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

A technique for predicting the temperature dependence of the B coefficients has been developed on the basis of the concept of structure-breaking and structure-making ions. The contribution of specific interactions between species, which is dominant for concentrated solutions, has been found to be a function of the ionic strength. The model reproduces the viscosity of aqueous systems ranging from dilute to concentrated solutions (up to ca. 30m) at temperatures up to 573 K with an accuracy that is appropriate for modeling industrially important systems. In particular, the viscosity of multicomponent systems can be accurately predicted using parameters obtained from single-solute systems.},

The previous paper studied the downstream intracelluar-signaling subsystem, while the present one is concerned with the upstream death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) subsystem. Under the assumption that the bind of Fas-associated death domains and FLICE-inhibitory proteins to the DISC is much faster than that of the initiator procaspases, we greatly simplify the upstream subsystem from 35 reactions with 26 species to 6 reactions with 9 species by adopting the classical and recently justified partial equilibrium approximation method. Numerical simulations show that the simplified model is in an excellent agreement with the original model. Most importantly, the simplified model clearly reveals the key reactants and dominated pathways in the Fas signaling process, and thus provides new insights into the apoptosis.},

  abstract     = {{\textcopyright}2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis GroupThe rate-controlled constrained-equilibrium (RCCE) method is a thermodynamics-based dimension reduction method that enables representation of chemistry involving ns chemical species in terms of a smaller number, nr, of constraints, and thus reduces the computational burden imposed by detailed chemical kinetics. The accuracy in the reduced description by RCCE strongly depends on the specification of constraints. In this work, the connection between the RCCE method and the conventional partial equilibrium assumption (PEA) method is revisited. It is shown that with the constraints being specified based on rate-controlling slow reactions, the RCCE method is equivalent to PEA. A criterion based on time scale analysis is then employed for the identification of fast reactions. Then the importance index, which represents the contribution of individual species to the slow dynamics of a reactive system, is proposed for the selection of species constraints in RCCE. This makes the thermodynamics-based constrained equilibrium manifolds (CEMs) a good approximation to the actual kinetics-controlled slow invariant manifolds (SIMs) in reactive systems. The method is demonstrated in the reduced descriptions of perfectly stirred reactors (PSRs) burning stoichiometric methane/air mixtures. Sample reaction states ranging from near-equilibrium conditions to the extinction turning points on the S-curve are examined for the identification of fast reactions and species constraints. Reduced descriptions of transient PSRs by RCCE are subsequently performed with their accuracy assessed against the full descriptions, in which all the chemical species are transported. The study shows that the dynamics predicted by RCCE agrees well with that from the full description and that near-limit reaction states are important for the selection of species constraints in RCCE.},

Temperature, pH, input reagent concentrations, and Pb/(Ti + (Zr)) and Pb/EDTA ratios were examined. Thermodynamic calculations from 25 to 100 °C indicated that, when the Pb/EDTA and Pb/(Ti + (Zr)) molar ratios were 2.0 and Pb input concentration was 0.1 m, phase-pure perovskites formed across the greatest pH range (7-14+). Precipitation of unwanted unary lead phases such as PbO was suppressed in all cases. In the absence of EDTA and solutions containing a molar excess of lead ions, the formation of phase-pure perovskites was limited to narrow pH ranges (5-8 and above 14) because of PbO precipitation. Theoretical predictions were experimentally validated with use of X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometry, and atomic absorption spectroscopy. Experimental results validated the theoretical predictions at temperatures above a minimum reaction temperature. Relative to comparable hydrothermal systems free of EDTA, the addition of EDTA was found to lower the minimum reaction temperature by 70 °C for PbTiO3 (70 °C) and 25 °C for PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 (125 °C).},

  abstract     = {The Rate-Controlled Constrained-Equilibrium (RCCE) method for the description of the time-dependent behavior of dynamical systems in non-equilibrium states is a general, effective, physically based method for model order reduction that was originally developed in the framework of thermodynamics and chemical kinetics. A generalized mathematical formulation is presented here that allows including nonlinear constraints in non-local equilibrium systems characterized by the existence of a non-increasing Lyapunov functional under the system's internal dynamics. The generalized formulation of RCCE enables to clarify the essentials of the method and the built-in general feature of thermodynamic consistency in the chemical kinetics context. In this paper, we work out the details of the method in a generalized mathematical-physics framework, but for definiteness we detail its well-known implementation in the traditional chemical kinetics framework. We detail proofs and spell out explicit functional dependences so as to bring out and clarify each underlying assumption of the method. In the standard context of chemical kinetics of ideal gas mixtures, we discuss the relations between the validity of the detailed balance condition off-equilibrium and the thermodynamic consistency of the method. We also discuss two examples of RCCE gas-phase combustion calculations to emphasize the constraint-dependent performance of the RCCE method.},

To simulate such reactive transfer processes, geochemical equations (equilibrium and kinetics equations) are coupled with compositional flows in porous media in order to represent, for example, precipitation/dissolution phenomena. The aim of the decoupled approach proposed consists in replacing the geochemical equilibrium solver with a substitute method to bypass the huge consuming time required to balance the geochemical system while keeping an accurate equilibrium calculation. This paper focuses on the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) to determine the geochemical equilibrium instead of solving geochemical equations system. To illustrate the proposed workflow, a 3D case study of CO2 storage in geological formation is presented.},

  abstract     = {A comprehensive model has been developed for the calculation of speciation, phase equilibria, enthalpies, heat capacities and densities in mixed-solvent electrolyte systems. The model incorporates chemical equilibria to account for chemical speciation in multiphase, multicomponent systems. For this purpose, the model combines standard-state thermochemical properties of solution species with an expression for the excess Gibbs energy. The excess Gibbs energy model incorporates a long-range electrostatic interaction term expressed by a Pitzer-Debye-H{\"{u}}ckel equation, a short-range interaction term expressed by the UNIQUAC model and a middle-range, second virial coefficient-type term for the remaining ionic interactions. The standard-state properties are calculated by using the Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers equation of state for species at infinite dilution in water and by constraining the model to reproduce the Gibbs energy of transfer between various solvents. The model is capable of accurately reproducing various types of experimental data for systems including aqueous electrolyte solutions ranging from infinite dilution to fused salts, electrolytes in organic or mixed, water+organic, solvents up to the solubility limit and acid-water mixtures in the full concentration range. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract     = {As computational challenges in optimization and statistical inference grow ever harder, algorithms that utilize derivatives are becoming increasingly more important. The implementation of the derivatives that make these algorithms so powerful, however, is a substantial user burden and the practicality of these algorithms depends critically on tools like automatic differentiation that remove the implementation burden entirely. The Stan Math Library is a C++, reverse-mode automatic differentiation library designed to be usable, extensive and extensible, efficient, scalable, stable, portable, and redistributable in order to facilitate the construction and utilization of such algorithms. Usability is achieved through a simple direct interface and a cleanly abstracted functional interface. The extensive built-in library includes functions for matrix operations, linear algebra, differential equation solving, and most common probability functions. Extensibility derives from a straightforward object-oriented framework for expressions, allowing users to easily create custom functions. Efficiency is achieved through a combination of custom memory management, subexpression caching, traits-based metaprogramming, and expression templates. Partial derivatives for compound functions are evaluated lazily for improved scalability. Stability is achieved by taking care with arithmetic precision in algebraic expressions and providing stable, compound functions where possible. For portability, the library is standards-compliant C++ (03) and has been tested for all major compilers for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.},

  abstract     = {Carbon dioxide injection in porous reservoirs is the basis for carbon capture and storage, enhanced oil and gas recovery. Injected carbon dioxide is stored at multiple scales in porous media, from the pore-level as a residual phase to large scales as macroscopic accumulations by the injection site, under the caprock and at reservoir internal capillary pressure barriers. These carbon dioxide saturation zones create regions across which the full spectrum of mutual CO{\$}{\_}2{\$}-H2O solubility may occur. Most studies assume that geochemical reaction is restricted to rocks and carbon dioxide-saturated formation waters, but this paradigm ignores injection of anhydrous carbon dioxide against brine and water-alternating-gas flooding for enhanced oil recovery. A series of laboratory experiments was performed to evaluate the reactivity of the common reservoir mineral dolomite with water-saturated supercritical carbon dioxide. Experiments were conducted at reservoir conditions (55 and 110 ??C, 25 MPa) and elevated temperature (220 ??C, 25 MPa) for approximately 96 and 164 h (4 and 7 days). Dolomite dissolves and new carbonate mineral precipitates by reaction with water-saturated supercritical carbon dioxide. Dolomite does not react with anhydrous supercritical carbon dioxide. Temperature and reaction time control the composition, morphology, and extent of formation of new carbonate minerals. Mineral dissolution and re-precipitation due to reaction with water-saturated carbon dioxide may affect the contact line between phases, the carbon dioxide contact angle, and the relative permeability and permeability distribution of the reservoir. These changes influence fundamental properties of hysteresis of drainage and imbibition cycles, rock wettability, and capillary pressure. The efficacy of physical carbon dioxide trapping mechanisms, integrity of caprock, and injectivity of a carbon dioxide storage reservoir as well as the injectivity and production rate of an enhanced oil recovery operation may be affected. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract     = {The propagation of grassland fires is simulated using a fully physical based model, partially developed during the FIRESTAR European Union programme. This approach, based on a multiphase formulation, includes the calculation of the degradation of the vegetation (by dehydration and pyrolysis) and the turbulent/reactive flow resulting from the mixing between the ambient gas (wind flow) and the pyrolizate. The solid fuel is simulated as homogeneous distribution of solid particles forming a porous media, interacting with the gas flow using a continuous distribution of drag forces. Other source terms representing the interactions between the vegetation and the gas flow are also taken into account, such as the production of water vapour and gaseous fuel, the radiation of soot particles and ashes, and the convective exchange in the energy balance. The model was validated from preliminary calculations carried out at small scale, for a homogeneous fuel bed (pine needles, excelsior, sticks) and compared with experimental results obtained in a wind tunnel. Calculations are then extended to study the propagation of fires through a flat grassland, for various wind speed conditions. The numerical results are compared to empirical and semi-empirical predictions obtained in similar conditions.}

  abstract     = {A generalized formulation for kinetically controlled reactions has been developed and incorporated into a multicomponent reactive transport model to facilitate the investigation of a large variety of problems involving inorganic and organic chemicals in variably saturated media. The general kinetic formulation includes intra-aqueous and dissolution-precipitation reactions in addition to geochemical equilibrium expressions for hydrolysis, aqueous complexation, oxidation-reduction, ion exchange, surface complexation, and gas dissolution-exsolution reactions. The generalized approach allows consideration of fractional order terms with respect to any dissolved species in terms of species activities or in terms of total concentrations, which facilitates the incorporation of a variety of experimentally derived rate expressions. Monod and inhibition terms can be used to describe microbially mediated reactions or to limit the reaction progress of inorganic reactions. Dissolution-precipitation reactions can be described as surface-controlled or transport, controlled reactions. The formulation also facilitates the consideration of any number of parallel reaction pathways, and reactions can be treated as irreversible or reversible processes. Two groundwater contamination scenarios, both set in variably saturated media but with significantly different geochemical reaction networks, are investigated and demonstrate the advantage of the generalized approach. The first problem focuses on a hypothetical case study of the natural attenuation of organic contaminants undergoing dissolution, volatilization, and biodegradation in an unconfined aquifer overlaid by unsaturated sediments. The second problem addresses the generation of acid mine drainage in the unsaturated zone of a tailings impoundment at the Nickel Rim Mine site near Sudbury, Ontario, and subsequent reactive transport in the saturated portion of the tailings.},

  abstract     = {Abstract This paper presents the development and illustration of a numerical model of reaction-based geochemical and biochemical processes with mixed equilibrium and kinetic reactions. The objective is to provide a general paradigm for modeling reactive chemicals in batch systems, with expectations that it is applicable to reactive chemical transport problems. The unique aspects of the paradigm are to simultaneously (1) facilitate the segregation (isolation) of linearly independent kinetic reactions and thus enable the formulation and parameterization of individual rates one reaction by one reaction when linearly dependent kinetic reactions are absent, (2) enable the inclusion of virtually any type of equilibrium expressions and kinetic rates users want to specify, (3) reduce problem stiffness by eliminating all fast reactions from the set of ordinary differential equations governing the evolution of kinetic variables, (4) perform systematic operations to remove redundant fast reactions and irrelevant kinetic reactions, (5) systematically define chemical components and explicitly enforce mass conservation, (6) accomplish automation in decoupling fast reactions from slow reactions, and (7) increase the robustness of numerical integration of the governing equations with species switching schemes. None of the existing models to our knowledge has included these scopes simultaneously. This model (BIOGEOCHEM) is a general computer code to simulate biogeochemical processes in batch systems from a reaction-based mechanistic standpoint, and is designed to be easily coupled with transport models. To make the model applicable to a wide range of problems, programmed reaction types include aqueous complexation, adsorption-desorption, ion-exchange, oxidation-reduction, precipitation-dissolution, acid-base reactions, and microbial mediated reactions. In addition, user-specified reaction types can be programmed into the model. Any reaction can be treated as fast/equilibrium or slow/kinetic reaction. An equilibrium reaction is modeled with an infinite rate governed by a mass action equilibrium equation or by a user-specified algebraic equation. Programmed kinetic reaction rates include multiple Monod kinetics, nth order empirical, and elementary formulations. In addition, user-specified rate formulations can be programmed into the model. No existing models to our knowledge offer these simultaneous features. Furthermore, most available reaction-based models assume chemical components a priori so that reactions can be written in basic (canonical) forms and implicitly assume that fast equilibrium reactions occur only for homogeneous reactions. The decoupling of fast reactions from slow reactions lessens the stiffness typical of these systems. The explicit enforcement of mass conservation overcomes the mass conservation error due to numerical integration errors. The removal of redundant fast reactions alleviates the problem of singularity. The exclusion of irrelevant slow reactions eliminates the issue of exporting their problematic rate formulations/parameter estimations to different environment conditions. Taking the advantage of the nonuniqueness of components, a dynamic basis-species switching strategy is employed to make the model numerically robust. Backward basis switching allows components to freely change in the simulation of the chemistry module, while being recovered for transport simulation. Three example problems were selected to demonstrate the versatility and robustness of the model. Published 2 April 2003.

Tapenade puts particular emphasis on adjoint differentiation, which computes gradients at a remarkably low cost. This article describes the principles of Tapenade, a subset of the general principles of AD. We motivate and illustrate with examples the AD model of Tapenade, that is, the structure of differentiated codes and the strategies used to make them more efficient. Along with this informal description, we formally specify this model by means of data-flow equations and rules of Operational Semantics, making this the reference specification of the tangent and adjoint modes of Tapenade. One benefit we expect from this formal specification is the capacity to formally study the AD model itself, especially for the adjoint mode and its sophisticated strategies. This article also describes the architectural choices of the implementation of Tapenade. We describe the current performance of Tapenade on a set of codes that include industrial-size applications. We present the extensions of the tool that are planned in a foreseeable future, deriving from our ongoing research on AD.}

The aim of the study was to develop a method to accurately measure the isobaric heat capacity (CP) of rare earth element (REE) phosphates, compare the results to data from adiabatic calorimetric experiments, and evaluate the deviation from ideality of the CP of the natural xenotime-(Y) solid solution. The measured CP data (in J mol-1 K-1) can be described by the relationships: 185.5 - 751.9T-0.5 - 3.261e + 06 T-2 for DyPO4; 207.2 - 1661T-0.5 - 5.289e + 05 T-2 for ErPO4; and 208 - 1241T-0.5 - 2.493e + 06 T-2 for xenotime-(Y); where T is the temperature in K. The heat capacity data for natural xenotime-(Y) were used to determine the excess function for the solid solution, which yields an excess heat capacity ranging between 7.9 and 10.7{\%}, well within the range of the DSC method used in this study. The experiments indicate that xenotime-(Y) forms a non-ideal solid solution. Future DSC studies will provide important data for developing a solid solution model for the incorporation of REE in xenotime-(Y).},

  abstract     = {Derivatives, mostly in the form of gradients and Hessians, are ubiquitous in machine learning. Automatic differentiation (AD), also called algorithmic differentiation or simply “autodiff”, is a family of techniques similar to but more general than backpropagation for efficiently and accurately evaluating derivatives of numeric functions expressed as computer programs. AD is a small but established field with applications in areas including computational fluid dynamics, atmospheric sciences, and engineering design optimization. Until very recently, the fields of machine learning and AD have largely been unaware of each other and, in some cases, have independently discovered each other's results. Despite its relevance, general-purpose AD has been missing from the machine learning toolbox, a situation slowly changing with its ongoing adoption under the names “dynamic computational graphs” and “differentiable programming”. We survey the intersection of AD and machine learning, cover applications where AD has direct relevance, and address the main implementation techniques. By precisely defining the main differentiation techniques and their interrelationships, we aim to bring clarity to the usage of the terms “autodiff”, “automatic differentiation”, and “symbolic differentiation” as these are encountered more and more in machine learning settings.},

  abstract     = {Pore-scale imaging and modelling - digital core analysis - is becoming a routine service in the oil and gas industry, and has potential applications in contaminant transport and carbon dioxide storage. This paper briefly describes the underlying technology, namely imaging of the pore space of rocks from the nanometre scale upwards, coupled with a suite of different numerical techniques for simulating single and multiphase flow and transport through these images. Three example applications are then described, illustrating the range of scientific problems that can be tackled: dispersion in different rock samples that predicts the anomalous transport behaviour characteristic of highly heterogeneous carbonates; imaging of super-critical carbon dioxide in sandstone to demonstrate the possibility of capillary trapping in geological carbon storage; and the computation of relative permeability for mixed-wet carbonates and implications for oilfield waterflood recovery. The paper concludes by discussing limitations and challenges, including finding representative samples, imaging and simulating flow and transport in pore spaces over many orders of magnitude in size, the determination of wettability, and upscaling to the field scale. We conclude that pore-scale modelling is likely to become more widely applied in the oil industry including assessment of unconventional oil and gas resources. It has the potential to transform our understanding of multiphase flow processes, facilitating more efficient oil and gas recovery, effective contaminant removal and safe carbon dioxide storage. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract     = {This chapter is focused on the study of transport properties in aqueous ionic solutions at elevated temperatures and pressures. The transport coefficients are defined in connection with the phenomenological laws that describe the transport of charge, mass or momentum in electrolyte solutions. The chapter summarizes the laws and the main characteristics of the transport parameters, which include electrical conductivity, transport numbers, diffusion, limiting laws, viscosity, and thermal conductivity. The most successful experimental methods and devices used to measure transport properties in high-temperature and -pressure aqueous solutions containing ionic solutes are High-Temperature Electrical Conductivity Cells and Electrochemical Methods. The simplest apparatus to measure the viscosity of electrolyte solutions is the rolling-ball viscometer, consisting of an inner tube, a ball, and an optical detector. The most precise method for measuring the viscosity of corrosive hydrothermal fluids is the oscillating-disk viscometer. The presence of ionic solutes generates new diffusion coefficients and also modifies to some extent the transport properties of water in the solution. This chapter deals mainly with those transport properties that are a direct consequence of the presence of ionic solutes, i.e., electrical conductivity and solute diffusion. The electrical conductivity, and the diffusion of salts and their ionic components are analyzed as a function of temperature and density (pressure) over the entire concentration range, from infinite dilution to very concentrated solutions.},

The Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers (HKF) model is widely used for calculating standard state thermodynamic properties of ions and complexes over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. To do this, the HKF model requires thermodynamic and electrostatic models of water solvent. In this study, we investigate and quantify the impact of choosing different models for calculating water solvent volumetric and dielectric properties, on the properties of aqueous species calculated using the HKF model. We identify temperature and pressure conditions at which the choice of different models can have a considerable effect on the properties of aqueous species and on fluid mineral equilibrium calculations. The investigated temperature and pressure intervals are 25-1000°C and 1-5 kbar, representative of upper to middle crustal levels, and of interest for modeling ore-forming processes. The thermodynamic and electrostatic models for water solvent considered are: Haar, Gallagher and Kell (1984), Wagner and Pru{\ss} (2002), and Zhang and Duan (2005), to calculate water volumetric properties, and Johnson and Norton (1991), Fernandez and others (1997), and Sverjensky and others (2014), to calculate water dielectric properties. We observe only small discrepancies in the calculated standard partial molal properties of aqueous species resulting from using different water thermodynamic models. However, large differences in the properties of charged species can be observed at higher temperatures (above 500°C) as a result of using different electrostatic models. Depending on the aqueous speciation and the reactions that control the chemical composition, the observed differences can vary. The discrepancy between various electrostatic models is attributed to the scarcity of experimental data at high temperatures. These discrepancies restrict the reliability of the geochemical modeling of hydrothermal and ore formation processes, and the retrieval of thermodynamic parameters from experimental data at elevated temperatures and pressures.},

In particular, solubilities and chemical speciation have been analyzed for various boron-containing systems, which represent an important subset of solution chemistry for such applications. The model has been shown to reproduce the speciation, solubility, and vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) data in the boric acid + water system over wide ranges of temperature and concentration. Specifically, solubilities have been accurately represented in the full concentration range of the B2O3 + H2O system (xB2O3 = 0{\~{}}1), which includes H3BO3. The accuracy of the model has also been demonstrated by calculating solubilities in various aqueous borate systems, i.e., MnO + B2O3 + H2O (where M = Li, Na, Ca, Mg), and their mixtures with a chloride salt or an acid (i.e., LiCl, NaCl, HCl). The model predicts the effects of chemical speciation, temperature, and concentrations of various acid, base, and salt components on the formation of competing solid phases. {\textcopyright} 2013 IUPAC.},

  abstract     = {A comprehensive model has been developed for calculating electrical conductivities of aqueous or mixed-solvent electrolyte systems ranging from dilute solutions to fused salts. The model consists of a correlation for calculating ionic conductivities at infinite dilution as a function of solvent composition and a method for predicting the effect of finite electrolyte concentration. The effect of electrolyte concentration is calculated using an extended form of the mean-spherical-approximation (MSA) theory coupled with a mixing rule for predicting the conductivities of multicomponent systems on the basis of the conductivities of constituent binary cation-anion subsystems. The MSA theory has been extended to very concentrated and mixed-solvent systems by introducing effective ionic radii that take into account various interactions between ions, solvent molecules, and ion pairs. The model has been coupled with thermodynamic equilibrium computations to provide the necessary concentrations of individual ions in complex, multicomponent systems. The model accurately reproduces experimental conductivity data over wide ranges of composition with respect to both solvents and electrolytes. In particular, the model is shown to be accurate for aqueous acids (e.g., H2SO4, HNO 3, and H3PO4) up to the pure acid limit, various nitrates ranging from dilute solutions to fused salts, salts in water + alcohol mixtures, and LiPF6 solutions in propylene and diethyl carbonate.},

When the pH is specified you enter a whole new world of thermodynamics. There are new thermodynamic properties, new names (transformed thermodynamic properties), and new values, which are quite different, expecially for the standard transformed Gibbs energy. This raises nomenclature problems because it is important to be able to distinguish between chemical equations and biochemical equations at a glance.

For a model system patterned after the European hot dry rock experiment at Soultz, we find significantly greater heat extraction rates for CO2 as compared to water. The strong dependence of CO2 mobility (=density/viscosity) upon temperature and pressure may lead to unusual production behavior, where heat extraction rates can actually increase for a time, even as the reservoir is subject to thermal depletion. We present the first ever, three-dimensional simulations of CO2 injection-production systems. These show strong effects of gravity on the mass flow and heat extraction due to the large contrast of CO2 density between cold injection and hot production conditions. The tendency for preferential flow of cold, dense CO2 along the reservoir bottom can lead to premature thermal breakthrough. The problem can be avoided by producing from only a limited depth interval at the top of the reservoir.},

  abstract     = {Geochemical modelling is fundamental for solving many environmental problems, and specially useful for modelling carbon storage into deep saline aquifers. This is because the injected greenhouse gas perturbs the reservoir, causing the subsurface fluid to become acidic, and consequently increasing its reactivity with the formation rock. Assessment of the long term fate of carbon dioxide, therefore, requires accurate calculations of the geochemical processes that occur underground. For this, it is important to take into account the major water-gas-rock effects that play important roles during the gas storage and migration. These reactive processes can in general be formulated in terms of chemical equilibrium or chemical kinetics models. This work proposes novel numerical methods for the solution of multiphase chemical equilibrium and kinetics problems. Instead of adapting or improving traditional algorithms in the geochemical modelling literature, this work adopts an approach of abstracting the underlying mathematics from the chemical problems, and investigating suitable, modern and efficient methods for them in the mathematical literature. This is the case, for example, of the adaptation of an interior-point minimisation algorithm for the calculation of chemical equilibrium, in which the Gibbs energy of the system is minimised. The methods were developed for integration into reactive transport simulators, requiring them to be accurate, robust and efficient. These features are demonstrated in the manuscript. All the methods developed were applied to problems relevant to carbon sequestration in saline aquifers. Their accuracy was assessed by comparing, for example, calculations of pH and CO2 solubility in brines against recent experimental data. Kinetic modelling of carbon dioxide injection into carbonate and sandstone saline aquifers was performed to demonstrate the importance of accounting for the water-gas-rock effects when simulating carbon dioxide sequestration. The results demonstrated that carbonate rocks, for example, increase the potential of the subsurface fluid to dissolve even more mobile CO2.},

The measurements indicate a strong increase in solubility with acidity and chloride concentration and a weak effect of hydrogen partial pressure. The obtained results have been combined with literature data for systems containing Mo(III), Mo(IV), and Mo(VI) in solutions to develop a comprehensive thermodynamic model of aqueous molybdenum chemistry. The model is based on a previously developed framework for simulating the properties of electrolyte systems ranging from infinite dilution to solid saturation or fused salt limit. To reproduce the measurements, the model assumes the presence of a chloride complex of Mo(III) (i.e., MoCl2+) and hydrolyzed species (MoOH2+, Mo(OH)2+, and Mo(OH)30) in addition to the Mo3+ ion. The model generally reproduces the experimental data within experimental scattering and provides a tool for predicting the phase behavior and speciation in complex, concentrated aqueous solutions. Thus, it provides a foundation for simulating the behavior of molybdenum species in localized corrosion environments. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Not only is it easy to grasp, it is a particularly intelligible quantity for which even the layman can develop a feeling. Moreover, this quantity is not only important for chemists.

In general, the parameter set for each initial density has to be obtained to compute detonation phenomena. For simulation of arbitrary initial densities cases, we try to construct a new simulation procedure that only employs the information of theoretical maximum density (TMD). The well known linear relationship between detonation velocity and initial density for high explosive has been employed for this study. Two types of simulation were carried out. The Gruneisen parameter as function of specific volume was calculated by solving the ordinary differential equation, and was employed as unified form EOS to simulate detonation phenomena. To obtain the information of the EOS for arbitrary initial density, the simulation of another type was executed. The calculation field is filled with the particle for TMD and the air, and the density of the high explosive is adjusted. It is investigated whether the velocity of detonation for an arbitrary density can be reproduced only by information on TMD. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

The model combines contributions of long-range (Coulombic) and short-range interactions. The long-range interaction contribution, which manifests itself in the relaxation effect, is obtained from the dielectric continuum-based mean-spherical approximation (MSA) theory for the unrestricted primitive model. The short-range interactions are represented using the hard-sphere model. In the combined model, aqueous species are characterized by effective radii, which depend on the ionic environment. For multicomponent systems, a mixing rule has been developed on the basis of phenomenological equations of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. The effects of complexation are taken into account by combining the diffusivity model with thermodynamic speciation calculations. The model accurately reproduces self-diffusivities of ions and neutral species in aqueous solutions ranging from infinitely dilute to concentrated (up to ca. 30 mol/kg of H2O). Also, the model makes it possible to predict diffusivities in multicomponent solutions using data for single-solute systems. {\textcopyright} 1998 American Chemical Society.},

An alkaline plume diffusing from an aged concrete (pH ??? 12.5) through argillite-type rocks has been modelled considering feedback of porosity value variations on transport properties using the reactive transport code TOUGHREACT. The mineralogical composition of the argillite is modified at the interface with the concrete. Diffusion of cementitious elements leads to rapid and strong porosity occlusion in the argillite. Numerical results show that both reaction rates and spatial refinement affect mineralogical transformation pathways. The variations in porosity and the extension of the zone affected by the alkaline perturbation are compared at different times. The major effects of mineral precipitation under kinetic constraints, rather than local equilibrium, are a delay in the porosity clogging and an increase in the extension of the alkaline perturbation in the clay formation. The same time-delay rise for the porosity occlusion also appears for the roughest spatial resolutions. A simulation as representative as possible of temporal and spatial scales of cementation processes must then be supported by more comparative data such as long term experimental investigations or natural analogues. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new method for multiphase equilibria calculation by direct minimization of the Gibbs free energy of multicomponent systems. The methods for multiphase equilibria calculation based on the equality of chemical potentials cannot guarantee the convergence to the correct solution since the problem is non-convex (with several local minima), and they can find only one for a given initial guess. The global optimization methods currently available are generally very expensive. A global optimization method called Tunneling, able to escape from local minima and saddle points is used here, and has shown to be able to find efficiently the global solution for all the hypothetical and real problems tested. The Tunneling method has two phases. In phase one, a local bounded optimization method is used to minimize the objective function. In phase two (tunnelization), either global optimality is ascertained, or a feasible initial estimate for a new minimization is generated. For the minimization step, a limited-memory quasi-Newton method is used. The calculation of multiphase equilibria is organized in a stepwise manner, combining phase stability analysis by minimization of the tangent plane distance function with phase splitting calculations. The problems addressed here are the vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid two-phase equilibria, three-phase vapor-liquid-liquid equilibria, and three-phase vapor-liquid-solid equilibria, for a variety of representative systems. The examples show the robustness of the proposed method even in the most difficult situations. The Tunneling method is found to be more efficient than other global optimization methods. The results showed the efficiency and reliability of the novel method for solving the multiphase equilibria and the global stability problems. Although we have used here a cubic equation of state model for Gibbs free energy, any other approach can be used, as the method is model independent. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Thus, it is shown that, if xcr does not exceed the order of 1-10 mm, and if the order of ts is not less than 1 year, initial corrosion current densities in real, open pits cannot exceed values of 10-4-10-3 A/cm2, with the understanding that the polarization curve (corrosion current density vs. potential and the surface concentration of species) does not change as the pit propagates. Simple analytical expressions for predicting potential and concentration drops in open corrosion cavities, and for predicting cavity propagation rate in systems containing uni- and bi-valent anions in stagnant electrolytes under well-mixed, external conditions have been obtained. These expressions can be used to extrapolate the results of short-term corrosion experiment to future times. In particular, it is shown that, if localized corrosion takes place in an electrolyte having a conductivity of the order of that of seawater, it is possible to neglect the potential drop in an open corrosion cavity and hence to consider the rate of pit propagation as being constant under constant environmental conditions. The same conclusion holds for the pitting of 316 L steel, practically for any composition of the external electrolyte. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {Mineralogical and petrographical investigations of a borehole sealed by concrete ("engineered analogue" of concrete/clay interactions) overcored at the Tournemire site offer the possibility to perform reactive transport modeling over a timescale of 15 years, which is significantly longer than standard durations of laboratory experiments. The HYTEC code was used to simulate mineralogical evolutions in the Tournemire argillite matrix and along small fractures, as well as in concrete, assuming either thermodynamic equilibrium approach or kinetic control coupled to diffusive transfer. The mineralogical profiles calculated in thermodynamic equilibrium and with kinetics are very similar in the concrete. In contrast, kinetics of dissolution and precipitation reactions is found to be necessary for a better reproduction of the experimental observations in the argillite samples compared to thermodynamic equilibrium calculations, in particular with respect to the extent of the alkaline perturbation. The major effects observed when considering kinetics in the calculations are to smooth the sharpness and intensity of the mineralogical transformation fronts, these fronts being predicted to occur deeper inside the argillite matrix ({\textless}1 cm) and the fractures (???2 cm), as well as to lessen clogging of pores within the argillite. At 15 ??C, the secondary mineral sequence simulated from the concrete to the argillite is: CSH/ettringite/carbonates at the concrete/argillite interface, followed by a zone of neoformation of clay-like phases and calcite, and a last zone with precipitation of calcite. Main discrepancies between the modeling results and the experimental observations are the precipitation of muscovite instead of K-feldspar and the neoformation of zeolites. Calculations also correctly predict that carbonates form at the concrete/argillite interface, which most probably result from concrete alteration and follow Ostwald's step rule of mineral precipitation with a predominance of metastable vaterite over calcite. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Both cases could be handled as optimization problems, satisfying the restrictions imposed by mole or atom balances, and non-negativity of number of moles. Convexity analyses were carried out, and the conditions were found in order to guarantee global minimum, for one liquid phase, one gas phase, and a number of solid phases.

The operator-overloading approach to performing reverse-mode automatic differentiation is the most convenient for the user but current implementations are typically 10-35 times slower than the original algorithm. In this paper a fast new operator-overloading method is presented that uses the expression template programming technique in C++ to provide a compile-time representation of each mathematical expression as a computational graph that can be efficiently traversed in either direction. Benchmarking with four different numerical algorithms shows this approach to be 2.6--9 times faster than current operator-overloading libraries, and 1.3--7.7 times more efficient in memory usage. It is typically less than 4 times the computational cost of the original algorithm, although poorer performance is found for all libraries in the case of simple loops containing no mathematical functions. An implementation is freely available in the Adept C++ software library.},

  abstract     = {A computer-oriented strategy has been developed for simultaneous evaluation and correlation of thermodynamic data on groups of chemically related species. A general empirical equation for the temperature dependence of the heat capacity of a species and derived functional relations for entropy, enthalpy, free energy, equilibrium constant, and electrochemical potential provides a mathematical model, whereby internally consistent analytical representations of thermodynamic functions may be obtained by multiple regression on experimental data. Programmining is simplified by defining the free energies of elements to be zero at 298.15/sup 0/K and the selected reference pressure. Conversion to other conventions is readily made after regression is completed. Error plots obtained from the initial parameter adjustment help to identify inconsistent data. Where justifiable, such data are rejected, and additional regressions are made to obtain an internally consistent description of the data. The species-related parameters from the final evaluation are then used with the mathematical model to calculate the thermochemical properties of the species considered. Application of this procedure is described, using, as examples, studies in the system Fe-C-H-O to derive thermodynamic functions for iron and its oxides and analysis of the system N-H-O to correlate the aqueous solubility of N/sub 2/ and NH/sub 3/ and the equilibrium between aqueous NH/sub 3/ and NH/sub 4//sup +/.},

  abstract     = {The impetus to write this book came about from three sources: The first source was the bi-yearly computational fluid dynamics (CFD) course, which has been offered over the last 15 years at the American University of Beirut (AUB) by both Drs. Darwish and Moukalled to senior and graduate mechanical engineering students, a course that focuses on the finite volume method (FVM) and CFD applications. The second source grew over the years to become more significant as it was noticed that graduates have started working on increasingly more focused areas and topics in CFD while becoming less cognizant of the general algorithmic expertise that earlier students developed. It became clear that there is a need not only to cover the basis of the numerics at the core of CFD codes but also to discuss the imple mentation issues to ensure thk all students receive a robust understanding of the techniques they are working on. Finally, the collaborative work in advanced numerics with Prof. Dr. Mangani fiom HSLU, Lucerne, Switzerland, which started during the Ph.D. supervision of M. Buchmyer (Ph.D.) from TUGraz, provided all the incentive to clarify and detail much of the numerical basis of the algorithms used in OpenFOAM{\textregistered}. To this end, it was decided that the book would combine a mix of numerical and implementation details allowing the reader, if she/he desires, to fiilly understand and implement a robust and versatile CFD code based on the FVM. This ambitious task was possible only by selecting from the various numerical methods in each of the topics covered in the book a handful set with which the authors are intimately familiar. The result is a book that covers intimately all the topics necessary for the development of a robust CFD code for the simulation of fluid flow at all speeds within the framework of the collocated unstructured finite volume method. The book was also written with the classroom in mind as reflected by the use of copious illustrations; the provision of many exercises covering numerics, pro gramming, and applications; the availability of an academic code (in MATLAB{\textregistered}) that imbeds much of the numerics presented in the book; and finally the various programs and routines in OpenFOAM{\textregistered}.},

The model combines thermodynamic speciation with electrochemical computations based on the mixed-potential theory. The effect of scaling is modeled by considering surface reactions between the metal and active solution species, which lead to the formation and dissolution of scales. The electrochemical computations take into account various partial anodic and cathodic processes on the metal surface, such as oxidation of iron and reduction of protons, water molecules, carbonic acid and hydrogen sulfide. The rates of the electrochemical processes are related to the presence of surface scales. The model has been verified by comparing calculated corrosion rates with experimental data over substantial ranges of environmental conditions. Good agreement with the data has been obtained. In particular, the model quantitatively reproduces the effect of variations in temperature, pH and partial pressures of CO2 and H2S on the formation of scales and corrosion rates.},

It is shown that the quasi-steady-state approximation represents the zeroth approximate solution of the perturbation problem dX dt = RV(X)+ 1 ??S W ??(X) with ?? ??? 1. The perturbation equation develops by subdivision of the flux rates of the model into the rates wi(X) = (1/??) w ??i(X) of fast reactions and the rates vj(X) of slow reactions. The matrix C=(R???S) denotes the stochiometric matrix of the reaction network. The analysis of this perturbation problem provides conditions for the applicability of the quasi-steady-state approximation in a given network. The paper presents a practical guide for the construction of the approximate solution. ?? 1983.}

  abstract     = {This paper describes a method for implementing surface reaction kinetics in lattice Boltzmann simulations. The interpolated boundary conditions are capable of simulating surface reactions and dissolution at both stationary and moving solid-fluid and fluid-fluid interfaces. Results obtained with the boundary conditions are compared to analytical solutions for first-order and constant-flux kinetic surface reactions in a one-dimensional half space, as well as to the analytical solution for evaporation from the surface of a cylinder. Excellent agreement between analytical and simulated results is obtained for a wide range of diffusivities, lattice velocities, and surface reaction rates. The boundary model's ability to represent dissolution in binary fluid mixtures is demonstrated by modeling diffusion from a rising bubble and dissolution of a droplet near a flat plate.}

  abstract     = {A review with 23 refs. Legendre transforms are used to introduce intensive variables as natural variables in the fundamental equations of thermodn. Natural variables are important because when a thermodn. potential can be detd. as a function of its natural variables, all the other thermodn. properties of the system can be obtained by taking partial derivs. It is usually more convenient to use thermodn. potentials that have intensive natural variables because they are often easily controlled than the conjugate extensive variables. This is illustrated for chem. reaction systems in which it is of interest to specify the chem. potential of a species (for example, the pH in a biochem. system). Since the elec. potentials of phases in a multi-phase system are not natural variables of the Gibbs free energy, it is useful to define a transformed Gibbs free energy, for which elec. potentials of phases are natural variables. The use of a Legendre transform brings in a new set of thermodn. properties, new Maxwell equations, Gibbs-Duhem equations, and Gibbs-Helmholtz equations. [on SciFinder (R)]},
