    "# Creating thermodynamic databases\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how you create your own thermodynamic databases in Reaktoro's YAML format. In these databases, you will have blocks of data for each species (and possibly elements as well, if they are not standard chemical elements from the periodic table).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand that Reaktoro expects each chemical species to know how to calculate its own *standard thermodynamic properties* at a given temperature $T$ and pressure $P$. The following standard thermodynamic properties of a species are expected as output in a standard thermodynamic model in Reaktoro:\n",
    "\n",
    "* its standard molar Gibbs energy of formation $G^{\\circ}$ (in J/mol)\n",
    "* its standard molar enthalpy of formation $H^{\\circ}$ (in J/mol)\n",
    "* its standard molar volume $V^{\\circ}$ (in m³/mol)\n",
    "* its standard molar isobaric heat capacity $C_{P}^{\\circ}$ (in J/(mol·K))\n",
    "* the temperature derivative of $V^{\\circ}$ at constant pressure $(\\partial V^{\\circ}/\\partial T)_P$ of the species (in m³/(mol·K))\n",
    "* the pressure derivative of $V^{\\circ}$ at constant temperature $(\\partial V^{\\circ}/\\partial P)_T$ (in m³/(mol·Pa))\n",
    "\n",
    "After computing these properties for a given $(T,P)$, several others can be easily obtained using thermodynamic relationships (e.g. $U^{\\circ} = H^{\\circ} - PV^{\\circ }$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Reaktoro already implements several standard thermodynamic models for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `StandardThermoModelConstant`\n",
    "* `StandardThermoModelInterpolation`\n",
    "* `StandardThermoModelHKF`\n",
    "* `StandardThermoModelMineralHKF`\n",
    "* `StandardThermoModelWaterHKF`\n",
    "* `StandardThermoModelMaierKelley`\n",
    "* `StandardThermoModelHollandPowell`\n",
    "* `StandardThermoModelNasa`\n",
    "\n",
    "We understand that thermodynamic data are not always formulated and organized in terms of standard thermodynamic properties of species. Many thermodynamic databases exist in which reaction properties are given (e.g., equilibrium constant of reaction, enthalpy of reaction, etc.). Reaktoro also implements several *thermodynamic reaction models* to meet this need:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ReactionThermoModelConstLgK`\n",
    "* `ReactionThermoModelVantHoff`\n",
    "* `ReactionThermoModelPhreeqcLgK`\n",
    "* `ReactionThermoModelGemsLgK`\n",
    "\n",
    "These models also expect temperature $T$ and pressure $P$ as inputs, and their output should be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the standard molar Gibbs energy of the reaction $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ (in J/mol)\n",
    "* the standard molar enthalpy of the reaction $\\Delta H^{\\circ}$ (in J/mol)\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "In the background, Reaktoro will convert your *thermodynamic reaction model* assigned to a species into a *standard thermodynamic model* for the same species.\n",

    "## A very simple custom thermodynamic database in YAML format\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider fictitious gaseous species A<sup>+</sup>, B<sup>-</sup>, and AB. The elements constituting these species are A and B. We consider the following reaction among them:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{A}^{+}+\\mathrm{B}^{-}\\rightleftharpoons\\mathrm{AB}\\qquad(\\lg K_{\\mathrm{AB}}=2)$$\n",

    "This example can be modified to work with species of other aggregate state as well, not just gaseous. And yes, gases can exist in charged stated: plasma!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we are interested in calculating the equilibrium state of these species at 25 {{deg}}C and 1 atm starting from an initial state with the same temperature and pressure containing 1 mol of AB. The first step is to create a database file in Reaktoro's YAML format containing the details and thermodynamic data of these species:\n",

    "        lgKr: 2.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{attention}\n",
    "Reaktoro strictly adopts SI units! Thus, molar mass must be provided in kg/mol, energy in J, mass in kg, volume in m<sup>3</sup>, amount in mol, temperature in K, pressure in Pa, etc.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes on the above database:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Elements A and B in this problem are not on the periodic table (element B here is not boron!). Thus, they need to be entered into the database. They are needed when building the chemical species. Note that their symbols are referred to in the `Elements` field of the species, eg `Elements: 1:A 1:B` for the `AB` species.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Species `A+` and `B-` compute their standard thermodynamic properties with a *constant standard thermodynamic model* implemented in `StandardThermoModelConstant`. For any $(T,P)$, its properties are constants. By setting `G0` to zero it means $G^{\\circ}_i=0$ for any temperature and pressure. We could have assigned values ​​to `H0`, `V0`, `VT0`, `VP0`, and `Cp0` as well. If not provided, they are zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The thermodynamic data available for species `AB` is in the form of reaction properties (reaction equilibrium constant). So we used `FormationReaction` above instead of `StandardThermoModel` for this. Reaktoro requires that a reaction that provides thermodynamic properties for a species be written as a *formation reaction*. In this example, the species `AB` should be considered as a product in the reaction and both `A+` and `B-` as reactants. The reaction is therefore expected to be `A+ + B- = AB`, with `AB` on the right side. In the `Reactants` field of `FormationReaction` for species `AB` we provide `1:A+ 1:B-`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If the reaction has more than one product, the other products are considered reactants with negative coefficients. For example, `H+ + HCO3- = CO2 + H2O`, a forming reaction for `CO2`, also has `H2O` as a product. This reaction can be interpreted as `H+ + HCO3- - H2O = CO2`, which would produce `Reagents: 1:H+ 1:HCO3- -1:H2O` for the `FormationReaction` of `CO2`. You'll see this in the next section where we show another example of constructing a custom database.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The `AB` species calculates its standard thermodynamic properties with a *constant lgK reaction model* implemented in `ReactionThermoModelConstLgK`. For each $(T,P)$ the equilibrium constant is the same. This equilibrium constant $K_{\\mathrm{AB}}$ is thus converted by the model to $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{AB}}^{\\circ}$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{AB}}^{\\circ}=-RT\\ln K_{\\mathrm{AB}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "   and from the definition of $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{AB}}^{\\circ}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{AB}}^{\\circ}\\equiv G_{\\mathrm{AB}}^{\\circ}-G_{\\mathrm{A^{+}}}^{\\circ} -G_{\\mathrm{B^{-}}}^{\\circ}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "   Reaktoro will calculate $G_{\\mathrm{AB}}^{\\circ}$ using:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$G_{\\mathrm{AB}}^{\\circ}=\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{AB}}^{\\circ}+G_{\\mathrm{A^{+}}}^{\\circ}+ G_{\\mathrm{B^{-}}}^{\\circ}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "   This is the principle behind Reaktoro's automated transformation of a thermodynamic model for a reaction to a standard thermodynamic model for a species.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The above conversion technique can produce infinite recursion if all species are defined in terms of formation reactions. We leave the mathematical identification of this recursion for you to figure out. Just note that it would make no sense to define the formation reaction for `AB` in terms of `A+` and `B-` and also define formation reactions for `A+` and `B-` in terms of themselves and `AB` . Infinite recursion can be removed by assigning a standard thermodynamic model to some species, the basic/master species. For example, a constant model that sets $G_{\\mathrm{A^{+}}}^{\\circ}$ and $G_{\\mathrm{B^{-}}}^{\\circ}$ to zero for the basic species.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The above convention of formation reactions is only necessary when providing the means to calculate standard thermodynamic properties for a species. When modeling chemical kinetics, Reaktoro has no absolute imposition on how you define your reactions!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now proceed with our chemical equilibrium calculation. We've saved this database file locally, with file name `db-fictious-simple.yml`, which is used next:"
