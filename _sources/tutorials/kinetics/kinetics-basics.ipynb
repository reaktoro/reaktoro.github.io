    "In this first tutorial about chemical kinetics modeling using Reaktoro, we simulate the dissolution of a 1 cm³ cube of halite crystal, NaCl(s), in pure water at 25 °C and 1 bar. We make the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The crystal remains a cube as it dissolves and its surface area over time can be computed as *current crystal volume* × 6 cm²/cm³.\n",
    "2. The reactions among aqueous species are much faster than that of the crystal dissolution. As a result, all aqueous species are assumed in equilibrium at all times.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "There is no need to define the aqueous reactions because Reaktoro uses a Gibbs energy minimization algorithm to compute the equilibrium state of all species in the system that are not restricted by chemical kinetics constraints.\n",
