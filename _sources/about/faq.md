## What is Reaktoro?

Reaktoro is a project that aims at the long-term to provide all you need for
simulating chemical processes. At the moment, it is available via C++ and
Python. The library is entirely implemented in C++ for performance reasons.
Python bindings are generated on top of the C++ interface for a more convenient
usage. Check the tutorials to see what you can currently do with it.

Because we believe you should know what goes inside it and help us with
further development and bug fixes!
