# Welcome

Welcome to the documentation of Reaktoro v2 for Python and C++, where we show
how Reaktoro can be used for a wide variety of chemical reaction calculations.

This website is still under-construction, but you should already find it
useful enough to get started with this new version of Reaktoro!

```{admonition} Looking for Reaktoro v1 website?
If you need to access Reaktoro v1 website, here is the link: https://reaktoro.org/v1

```{admonition} Examples in the tutorials not working?
:class: attention
This website is under active development, and many new features in Reaktoro are being developed in parallel and documented here straight away. If you installed Reaktoro before a new feature was introduced and documented here, your installed `reaktoro` package will not support that feature. Make sure you update the conda environment containing the `reaktoro` package, using either Anaconda Navigator or the following conda command:

~~~bash
conda activate rkt
conda update --all
~~~

assuming above you named `rkt` as the conda environment containing `reaktoro`. For installation instructions using conda, please check [these instructions](installation/installation-using-conda).
