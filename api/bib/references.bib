abstract = {Realistic simulation of structurally complex reservoirs (SCR) is challenging in at least three ways: (1) geological structures must be represented and discretized accurately on vastly different length scales; (2) extreme ranges and discontinuous variations of material properties have to be associated with the discretized structures and accounted for in the computations; and (3) episodic, highly transient and often localized events such as well shut-in have to be resolved adequately within the overall production history, necessitating a highly adaptive resolution of time. To facilitate numerical experiments that elucidate the emergent properties, typical states and state transitions of SCRs, an application programmer interface (API) called complex systems modelling platform(CSMPþþ) has been engineered in ANSI/ISOCþþ. It implements a geome- try and process-basedSCRdecomposition in space and time, and uses an algebraic multigrid solver (SAMG) for the spatio-temporal integration of the governing partial differential equations. This paper describes a new SCR simulation workflow including a two-phase fluid flow model that is compared with ECLIPSE in a single-fracture flow simulation. Geologically realistic application examples are presented for incompressible 2-phase flow, compressible 3-phase flow, and pressure-diffusion in a sector-scale model of a structurally complex reservoir.},

abstract = {Sorption, co-precipitation and re-crystallisation are important retention processes for dissolved contaminants (radionuclides) migrating through the sub-surface. The retention of elements is usually measured by empirical partition coefficients (Kd), which vary in response to many factors: temperature, solid/liquid ratio, total contaminant loading, water composition, host-mineral composition, etc. The Kd values can be predicted for in-situ conditions from thermodynamic modelling of solid solution, aqueous solution or sorption equilibria, provided that stoichiometry, thermodynamic stability and mixing properties of the pure components are known (Example 1). Unknown thermodynamic properties can be retrieved from experimental Kd values using inverse modelling techniques (Example 2). An efficient, advanced tool for performing both tasks is the Gibbs Energy Minimization (GEM) approach, implemented in the userfriendly GEM-Selector (GEMS) program package, which includes the Nagra-PSI chemical thermodynamic database. The package is being further developed at PSI and used extensively in studies relating to nuclear waste disposal.},

abstract = {Fundamental determinations of the physical properties of seawater have previously been made for Atlantic surface waters, referred to as “Standard Seawater”. In this paper a Reference Composition consisting of the major components of Atlantic surface seawater is determined using these earlier analytical measurements. The stoichiometry of sea salt introduced here is thus based on the most accurate prior determination of the composition, adjusted to achieve charge balance and making use of the 2005 atomic weights. Reference Seawater is defined as any seawater that has the Reference Composition and a new Reference-Composition Salinity SR is defined to provide the best available estimate of the Absolute Salinity of both Reference Seawater and the Standard Seawater that was used in the measurements of the physical properties. From a practical point of view, the value of SR can be related to the Practical Salinity S by SR=(35.16504/35)gkg-1×S. Reference Seawater that has been “normalized” to a Practical Salinity of 35 has a Reference-Composition Salinity of exactly SR=35.16504gkg−1. The new independent salinity variable SR is intended to be used as the concentration variable for future thermodynamic functions of seawater, as an SI-based extension of Practical Salinity, as a reference for natural seawater composition anomalies, as the currently best estimate for Absolute Salinity of IAPSO Standard Seawater, and as a theoretical model for the electrolyte mixture “seawater”.},

abstract = {The lteration of basaltic glass was studied experimentally at elevated CO 2 pressures ({\~{}}10-25bar) and hydrothermal conditions (75-250??C) to determine the effects of temperature and extent of reaction (??) on the secondary mineral formation and compositional evolution of alteration assemblages resulting from CO 2-water-basalt interaction. At {\textless}100??C, the alteration products consisted of concentric layers of ankerite and dolomite-ankerite solid solutions (Ca-Mg-Fe carbonates) and amorphous silica. At ???150??C, mixed Ca-Mg-Fe smectites and chlorite, calcite, amorphous silica and zeolites formed instead of Ca-Mg-Fe carbonates. Competing reactions between carbonates and clays for major divalent cations (Ca, Mg and Fe) were affected by the extent of reaction with smectites formed initially and progressively being replaced by calcite and chlorite. The basaltic glass dissolution rate and mechanism were also affected by temperature and reaction time. At lower temperatures (???150??C), a hydrated leached layer formed on the glass surface and the mass fluxes in the system were largely controlled by the dissolution rate and mechanism of the glass, whereas at higher temperature (250??C) the dissolution rate of the basaltic glass was fast with the reactions primarily driven by secondary mineral replacement and growth. We conclude that the driving force for carbonate mineralization in basaltic glass at elevated CO 2 conditions is linked to the geochemical behavior and mobility of Ca, Mg and Fe together with the availability of Si for Al-Si-mineral formation. At {\textless}100??C, the divalent cations are available for Ca-Mg-Fe carbonate formation, whereas at ???150??C abundant clays limit the availability of Mg and Fe resulting in calcite being the only carbonate formed. This implies a quantitatively more effective fixation of CO 2 at {\textless}100??C associated with the formation of Ca-Mg-Fe carbonates. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Chemical equilibrium calculations are essential for many environmental problems. It is also a fundamental tool for chemical kinetics and reactive transport modelling, since these applications may require hundreds to billions equilibrium calculations in a single simulation. Therefore, an equilibrium method for such critical applications must be very efficient, robust and accurate. In this work we demonstrate the potential effectiveness of a novel Gibbs energy minimisation algorithm for reactive transport simulations. The algorithm includes strategies to converge from poor initial guesses; capabilities to specify non-linear equilibrium constraints such as pH of an aqueous solution and activity or fugacity of a species; a rigorous phase stability test to determine the unstable phases; and a strategy to boost the convergence speed of the calculations to quadratic rates, requiring only few iterations to converge. We use this equilibrium method to solve geochemical problems relevant to carbon storage in saline aquifers, where aqueous, gaseous and minerals phases are present. The problems are formulated to mimic the ones found in kinetics and transport simulations, where a sequence of equilibrium calculations are performed, each one using the previous solution as the initial guess. The efficiency and convergence rates of the calculations are presented, which require an average of 1-2 iterations. These results indicate that critical applications such as chemical kinetics and reactive transport modelling can potentially benefit by using this multiphase equilibrium algorithm. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {A mathematical model for the solution of a set of chemical equilibrium equations in a multi-species and multiphase chemical system is described. The computer-aid solution of model is achieved by means of a Newton-Raphson method enhanced with a line-search scheme, which deals with the non-negative constrains. The residual function, representing the distance to the equilibrium, is defined from the chemical potential (or Gibbs energy) of the chemical system. Local minimums are potentially avoided by the prioritization of the aqueous reactions with respect to the heterogeneous reactions. The formation and release of gas bubbles is taken into account in the model, limiting the concentration of volatile aqueous species to a maximum value, given by the gas solubility constant.The reaction extents are used as state variables for the numerical method. As a result, the accepted solution satisfies the charge and mass balance equations and the model is fully compatible with general reactive transport models. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Reactive transport codes that use a Gibbs Energy Minimization (GEM) to solve chemical equilibria are uncommon. We present a new coupling of the Richards flow module of the Finite Element (FE) based OpenGeoSys code with the GEM based chemical solver GEMS3K. The coupled code is highly parallelized using an overlapping domain decomposition approach in combination with execution of multiple threads that solve chemical equilibria in parallel. FE reactive transport schemes are often affected by spurious concentration oscillations. We effectively suppress these oscillations with a linearized algebraic flux corrected transport (FCT) algorithm. An application example is presented which investigates the evolution of material interfaces in a deep geological repository for nuclear waste. The example uses all features of the new coupled code: flow and multi-component transport in variably saturated media, and a very complex chemical setup which makes extensive use of (non-linear) solid solution formulations for mineral phases. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method is presented that aims to overcome some of the drawbacks of contemporary SQP methods. It avoids the difficulties associated with indefinite quadratic programming subproblems by defining this subproblem to be always convex. The novel feature of the approach is the addition of an equality constrained quadratic programming (EQP) phase that promotes fast convergence and improves performance in the presence of ill conditioning. This EQP phase uses exact second-order information and can be implemented using either a direct solve or an iterative method. The paper studies the global and local convergence properties of the new algorithm and presents a set of numerical experiments to illustrate its practical performance.},

Combined with correlations among parameters in the revised Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers (HKF) equation of state (Shock et al., 1992), these estimates permit predictions of standard partial molal volumes, heat capacities, and entropies, as well as apparent standard partial molal enthalpies and Gibbs free energies of formation to 1000 degrees C and 5 kb for hundreds of inorganic aqueous species of interest in geochemistry. Data and parameters for more than 300 inorganic aqueous species are presented. Close agreement between calculated and experimentally determined equilibrium constants for acid dissociation reactions and cation hydrolysis reactions supports the generality and validity of these predictive methods. These data facilitate the calculation of the speciation of major, minor, and trace elements in hydrothermal and metamorphic fluids throughout most of the crust of the Earth.},

abstract = {Hydrothermal flow experiments of single-pass injection of CO2-charged brine were conducted on nine dolomite cores to examine fluid-rock reactions in dolomite reservoirs under geologic carbon sequestration conditions. Post-experimental X-ray computed tomography (XRCT) analysis illustrates a range of dissolution patterns, and significant increases in core bulk permeability were measured as the dolomite dissolved. Outflow fluids were below dolomite saturation, and cation concentrations decreased with time due to reductions in reactive surface area with reaction progress. To determine changes in reactive surface area, we employ a power-law relationship between reactive surface area and porosity (Luquot and Gouze, 2009). The exponent in this relationship is interpreted to be a geometrical parameter that controls the degree of surface area change per change in core porosity. Combined with XRCT reconstructions of dissolution patterns, we demonstrate that this exponent is inversely related to both the flow path diameter and tortuosity of the dissolution channel. Even though XRCT reconstructions illustrate dissolution at selected regions within each core, relatively high Ba and Mn recoveries in fluid samples suggest that dissolution occurred along the core's entire length and width. Analysis of porosity-permeability data indicates an increase in the rate of permeability enhancement per increase in porosity with reaction progress as dissolution channels lengthen along the core. Finally, we incorporate the surface area-porosity model of Luquot and Gouze (2009) with our experimentally fit parameters into TOUGHREACT to simulate experimental observations. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {An extensive computer program called ChemSage, based upon the SOLGASMIX Gibbs energy minimizer, is presented together with several examples which illustrate its use. ChemSage was designed to perform three types of thermochemical calculations in complex systems involving phases exhibiting nonideal mixing properties. These are the calculation of thermodynamic functions, heterogeneous phase equilibria, and steady-state conditions for the simulation of simple multistage reactors. The thermodynamic functions module calculates specific heat, enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs energy with respect to a chosen reference state for a given phase and, if this phase is a mixture, the partial properties of its components. Chemical equilibrium calculations can be made for a system which has been uniquely defined with respect to temperature, pressure (or volume), and composition. One of these quantities may also be replaced by an extensive property or phase target,e.g., for the calculation of adiabatic and liquidus temperatures, respectively.},

@article{Wang2013,
abstract = {Carbon dioxide injection in porous reservoirs is the basis for carbon capture and storage, enhanced oil and gas recovery. Injected carbon dioxide is stored at multiple scales in porous media, from the pore-level as a residual phase to large scales as macroscopic accumulations by the injection site, under the caprock and at reservoir internal capillary pressure barriers. These carbon dioxide saturation zones create regions across which the full spectrum of mutual CO2-H2O solubility may occur. Most studies assume that geochemical reaction is restricted to rocks and carbon dioxide-saturated formation waters, but this paradigm ignores injection of anhydrous carbon dioxide against brine and water-alternating-gas flooding for enhanced oil recovery. A series of laboratory experiments was performed to evaluate the reactivity of the common reservoir mineral dolomite with water-saturated supercritical carbon dioxide. Experiments were conducted at reservoir conditions (55 and 110 ??C, 25 MPa) and elevated temperature (220 ??C, 25 MPa) for approximately 96 and 164 h (4 and 7 days). Dolomite dissolves and new carbonate mineral precipitates by reaction with water-saturated supercritical carbon dioxide. Dolomite does not react with anhydrous supercritical carbon dioxide. Temperature and reaction time control the composition, morphology, and extent of formation of new carbonate minerals. Mineral dissolution and re-precipitation due to reaction with water-saturated carbon dioxide may affect the contact line between phases, the carbon dioxide contact angle, and the relative permeability and permeability distribution of the reservoir. These changes influence fundamental properties of hysteresis of drainage and imbibition cycles, rock wettability, and capillary pressure. The efficacy of physical carbon dioxide trapping mechanisms, integrity of caprock, and injectivity of a carbon dioxide storage reservoir as well as the injectivity and production rate of an enhanced oil recovery operation may be affected. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We present a software tool for simulations of flow and multi-component solute transport in two- and three-dimensional domains in combination with comprehensive intra-phase and inter-phase geochemistry. The software uses IPhreeqc as a reaction engine to the multi-purpose, multidimensional finite element solver COMSOL Multiphysics?? for flow and transport simulations. Here we used COMSOL to solve Richards' equation for aqueous phase flow in variably saturated porous media. The coupling procedure presented is in principle applicable to any simulation of aqueous phase flow and solute transport in COMSOL. The coupling with IPhreeqc gives major advantages over COMSOL's built-in reaction capabilities, i.e., the soil solution is speciated from its element composition according to thermodynamic mass action equations with ion activity corrections. State-of-the-art adsorption models such as surface complexation with diffuse double layer calculations are accessible. In addition, IPhreeqc provides a framework to integrate user-defined kinetic reactions with possible dependencies on solution speciation (i.e., pH, saturation indices, and ion activities), allowing for modelling of microbially mediated reactions. Extensive compilations of geochemical reactions and their parameterization are accessible through associated databases. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A variety of flash specifications of practical importance can be formulated as minimization of a thermodynamic state function. It is well known that the solution for the PT-flash yields the global minimum of the mixture Gibbs energy, but in addition specifications of PH, PS, TV, UV or SV all permit selections of thermodynamic state functions for which a global minimum must be located. Two important advantages are obtained with the minimization based approach. First, the desired solution is known to be unique, and second, stability analysis can be used to verify its correctness and to determine the number of equilibrium phases. For the PT-flash the solution can be determined by unconstrained minimization, whereas the remaining specifications are accompanied by one or two nonlinear constraints and thus less straightforward to attack. We present here two approaches for dealing with such specifications. The first is a nested optimization approach where T and/or P are the dependent variables in the outer loop, and where a PT-flash is solved in the inner loop. The essential advantage of this formulation is that it is very easy to implement but the drawback is the additional cost of the nested loops. The second approach is based on a modified objective function in which all constraints are removed, but where a saddle point rather than a minimum must be located. The resulting equations are solved by a global Newton's method, and it is shown that a common Jacobian matrix can be used with all the specifications given above.},

abstract = {Water-rock interaction and reactive transport modeling is an important tool for deciphering chemical and physical reactions occurring in sediments and rocks. The modeling methodology calls for solving conservation equations to account for the interaction between mass-transfer and reaction processes using a sequential iteration numerical method.$\backslash$nThe formalism presented here improves upon the traditional approach by reformulating conservation equations to express chemical elemental mass evolution. The elemental conservation equations describe mass change through mass-transfer and kinetic reactions of solids, and solute-solute interaction (equilibrium) reaction expressions. The system of equations is solved using a sequential iteration method, whereby globally discretized mass-transfer coefficients of conservation equations are injected explicitly into the conservation equations and solved locally at each node. The result is a mathematically simple approach that eliminates the traditionally required use of primary and secondary species classification. The formalism also allows the use of solute-specific diffusivities. In addition, the tight coupling between mass-transfer and reactions achieved by the methodology also allows nonlinear self-organization or pattern-forming phenomena to be captured.$\backslash$nThe methodology is demonstrated with simulations of (1) a diffusive-reaction system involving patterned hematite nucleation, and (2) a flow-through system where CO2-charged water interacts with formation water in a sandstone reservoir. Both are isothermal one-dimensional simulations. In the first example, convergent diffusive infiltration of Fe++ and O2 from two opposite ends produces patterned precipitates. A natural analog of such phenomena is the occurrence of iron-oxide concretions in Navajo Sandstones of Utah and Arizona. The second example demonstrates the formation of a diffusive solute migration front ahead of advective effluent displacement and reaction fronts. Such phenomena are observed when large quantities of CO2 are injected into geologic formations. The early arrival of diffusive solute fronts at nearby monitoring wells are noted by decreasing water pH and raised alkalinity some time before the arrival of the effluent.},

abstract = {The interaction of CO 2-rich waters with basaltic glass was studied experimentally and using reaction path and kinetic modeling in order to improve our understanding on the integrated effects of temperature, acid supply and reaction progress on the fluid composition, secondary mineralogy and mass of CO 2 mineralization during progressive water-rock interaction. Hydrothermal batch type experiments were carried out at 75, 150 and 250°C and {\~{}}80 to 270mmol/kg initial dissolved CO 2 concentrations. At 75°C, the pH was buffered at {\~{}}4.5 with Ca, Mg, Fe and Si being incorporated into Ca-Mg-Fe carbonates and chalcedony. At 150 and 250°C, the pH increased from {\~{}}5.5 to {\textgreater}6 with Ca being incorporated into calcite and Mg, Fe, Al and Si into smectites and/or chlorite depending on temperature. Comparison between the experimental results and the reaction path models indicated that the basalt alteration and sequestration of CO 2 depend on temperature. The mineralization of chalcedony at 75°C inhibited the formation of clays resulting in Ca, Mg and Fe being available for carbonate mineralization. At 150 and 250°C, Mg and Fe were predominantly incorporated into clays limiting the availability of Mg and Fe, resulting in calcite being the only carbonate forming. Comparison of the reaction path model with kinetic simulations yielded a similar modeled secondary mineralogy, and additionally showed that the transition of the formation of Ca-Mg-Fe carbonates at {\textless}150°C to calcite at {\textless}150°C was not solely related to temperature dependent mineral properties, but also related to the faster reaction kinetics observed at {\textless}150°C. This was especially reflected in the basaltic glass and smectite reaction rates. According to mass balance calculations using the reaction path simulations, the maximum amount of CO 2 mineralized was reached at 75°C and pH of {\~{}}5.5, indicating that CO 2 sequestration is favorable at {\textless}100°C. The experimental results and geochemical models were compared with data on natural waters and suggest that during progressive CO 2-water-basalt interaction, the water composition and reaction stoichiometry were closely reproduced by mineral-solution equilibria at 75 to 250°C and were controlled by temperature, pH and reaction progress. In turn, the pH was determined by the input of CO 2 and amount of basalt dissolution. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A generalized formulation for kinetically controlled reactions has been developed and incorporated into a multicomponent reactive transport model to facilitate the investigation of a large variety of problems involving inorganic and organic chemicals in variably saturated media. The general kinetic formulation includes intra-aqueous and dissolution-precipitation reactions in addition to geochemical equilibrium expressions for hydrolysis, aqueous complexation, oxidation-reduction, ion exchange, surface complexation, and gas dissolution-exsolution reactions. The generalized approach allows consideration of fractional order terms with respect to any dissolved species in terms of species activities or in terms of total concentrations, which facilitates the incorporation of a variety of experimentally derived rate expressions. Monod and inhibition terms can be used to describe microbially mediated reactions or to limit the reaction progress of inorganic reactions. Dissolution-precipitation reactions can be described as surface-controlled or transport, controlled reactions. The formulation also facilitates the consideration of any number of parallel reaction pathways, and reactions can be treated as irreversible or reversible processes. Two groundwater contamination scenarios, both set in variably saturated media but with significantly different geochemical reaction networks, are investigated and demonstrate the advantage of the generalized approach. The first problem focuses on a hypothetical case study of the natural attenuation of organic contaminants undergoing dissolution, volatilization, and biodegradation in an unconfined aquifer overlaid by unsaturated sediments. The second problem addresses the generation of acid mine drainage in the unsaturated zone of a tailings impoundment at the Nickel Rim Mine site near Sudbury, Ontario, and subsequent reactive transport in the saturated portion of the tailings.},

For a model system patterned after the European hot dry rock experiment at Soultz, we find significantly greater heat extraction rates for CO2 as compared to water. The strong dependence of CO2 mobility (=density/viscosity) upon temperature and pressure may lead to unusual production behavior, where heat extraction rates can actually increase for a time, even as the reservoir is subject to thermal depletion. We present the first ever, three-dimensional simulations of CO2 injection-production systems. These show strong effects of gravity on the mass flow and heat extraction due to the large contrast of CO2 density between cold injection and hot production conditions. The tendency for preferential flow of cold, dense CO2 along the reservoir bottom can lead to premature thermal breakthrough. The problem can be avoided by producing from only a limited depth interval at the top of the reservoir.},

abstract = {The origin of pyroxenites and their relation to melt migration in the mantle have been investigated in two pyroxenite-rich zones in the Beni Bousera massif. Based on combined field, microtextural, mineralogical and geochemical observations, the pyroxenites were separated into four types. Type-I Cr-diopside websterites contain bright green diopside and have primitive bulk Ni, Cr and Mg-number. Their trace element systematics are characterized by slight light rare earth element (LREE) enrichment compared with the middle (MREE) and heavy (H)REE, and negative high field strength element (HFSE) anomalies in bulk-rock and mineral compositions suggesting that they result from melting of metasomatized mantle. Trace element concentrations of melts calculated to be in equilibrium with Type-I cpx have a subduction-like signature and show a close similarity to certain lavas erupted in the Alboran Basin. Calculated mineral equilibration temperatures of [{\~{}}]1200 to 1350{\{}degrees{\}}C are close to the basalt liquidus and higher than for other pyroxenite types in Beni Bousera, which generally yield {\textless}1100{\{}degrees{\}}C. Type-II spinel websterites are also primitive, but contain augitic clinopyroxene; their whole-rock compositions are characterized by high Ti, Ni, and Mg-number, intermediate Cr and trace element patterns with LREE depletion over the MREE and HREE. Type-III garnet pyroxenites, which include the famous diamond-pseudomorph-bearing garnet pyroxenites, are more evolved than Types-I and -II and have low and variable Mg-number correlating with an Fe-enrichment trend. High bulk-rock and garnet HREE to LREE ratios result from high-pressure fractionation of garnet and augitic cpx at calculated pressures of {\textgreater}45 to 20-30 kbar. Type-III pyroxenites display strong variations of LREE and HFSE depletion and strong bulk Nb/Ta fractionation. Calculated melts in equilibrium with augitic cpx are variably enriched in incompatible trace elements similar to intraplate basalts. Type-IV pyroxenites are composed of green diopside, opx, garnet and plagioclase and/or spinel. Whole-rocks have high Na2O, CaO and Al2O3 concentrations and high Mg-number, are HREE depleted, and have positive Eu and Sr anomalies. Garnets are characterized by low HREE/MREE and positive Eu anomalies. The absence of bulk-rock HREE enrichment indicates a metamorphic origin for this garnet, which is corroborated by the presence of Al-rich metamorphic spinels. Relict magmatic plagioclase indicates a shallower ({\textless}10 kbar) crustal origin for these pyroxenites. Their metamorphic assemblage yields temperatures and pressures of 800-980{\{}degrees{\}}C and 14 kbar, indicating a pressure increase during the metamorphic overprint. The whole-rock geochemistry of Type-IV pyroxenites is comparable with that of rocks from the lower crustal section of the Kohistan (northern Pakistan) paleo-arc, indicating a possible origin of these rocks as cumulates in the deeper arc crust and subsequent delamination into the underlying mantle.},

abstract = {The transport and reaction of fluids in porous media results in unique pore growth and channel evolution as the media are dissolved. This often leads to the formation of highly conductive flow channels, commonly referred to as wormholes. The objective of this work is to predict the influence of transport and reaction on the structure of the wormhole channels. An experimental and theoretical investigation of a variety of fluid systems, including strong acids, weak acids, and chelating agents, provides a wide range of conditions for studying wormhole formation. A generalized description of the dissolution phenomenon is introduced, and a common dependence on the Damk{\"{o}}hler number is demonstrated. The Damk{\"{o}}hler number is shown to dictate the type of wormhole structure formed by systems with various degrees of transport and reaction limitations. An optimum Damk{\"{o}}hler number for channel formation is observed at a value of approximately 0.29 for all of the fluid systems investigated. The stochastic nature of the dissolution phenomenon is described using network models. Results from a 2-D network model and a 3-D physically representative network model agree qualitatively with experimental results and substantiate the existence of an optimum Damk{\"{o}}hler number.},

abstract = {This report presents the latest in a number of versions of chemical equilibrium and applications programs developed at the NASA Lewis Research Center over more than 40 years. These programs have changed over the years to include additional features and improved calculation techniques and to take advantage of constantly improving computer capabilities. The minimization-of-free-energy approach to chemical equilibrium calculations has been used in all versions of the program since 1967. The two principal purposes of this report are presented in two parts. The first purpose, which is accomplished here in part 1, is to present in detail a number of topics of general interest in complex equilibrium calculations. These topics include mathematical analyses and techniques for obtaining chemical equilibrium; formulas for obtaining thermodynamic and transport mixture properties and thermodynamic derivatives; criteria for inclusion of condensed phases; calculations at a triple point; inclusion of ionized species; and various applications, such as constant-pressure or constant-volume combustion, rocket performance based on either a finite- or infinite-chamber-area model, shock wave calculations, and Chapman-Jouguet detonations. The second purpose of this report, to facilitate the use of the computer code, is accomplished in part 2, entitled 'Users Manual and Program Description'. Various aspects of the computer code are discussed, and a number of examples are given to illustrate its versatility.},

@article{Solsvik2016,
abstract = {In the tubular reactor models the mass and heat source terms due to chemical reactions in the species mass balances and temperature equation are conventionally determined from kinetic rate expressions. In many cases a kinetic rate model is not available but the chemical equilibrium conversion can be determined from reaction equilibrium calculations minimizing the Gibbs or Helmholtz free energies. Although a process is believed to behave physically like a tubular reactor, previous feasibility and design studies have typically disregarded fluid flow and mass- and heat transfer limitations and performed a classical chemical equilibrium calculation. For non-adiabatic cases, valuable information on the heat transfer flux limitations of the chemical process at the wall (often provided by a specified axial heating/cooling media temperature profile) is lost when simplifying a model representing the physical tubular reactor process behavior by considering a classical thermodynamic system having uniform state properties. For this reason, in the present study, a new type of tubular reactor model, which we name the differential Gibbs (or Helmholtz) reactor model, is presented to improve on the conventional feasibility and design model. In the differential Gibbs (or Helmholtz) reactor model, the chemical conversion and the reaction heat are determined assuming chemical reaction equilibrium conditions along the axial flow direction by minimizing the Gibbs (or Helmholtz) free energy. The new model is verified through comparison with the conventional differential tubular model using the fast reaction kinetics of the steam-methane reforming process and neglected mass diffusion limitation of the catalyst.},

abstract = {We formulate an algorithm for the calculation of stable phase relations of a system with constrained bulk composition as a function of its environmental variables. The basis of this algorithm is the approximate representation of the free energy composition surfaces of solution phases by inscribed polyhedra. This representation leads to discretization of high variance phase fields into a continuous mesh of smaller polygonal fields within which the composition and physical properties of the phases are uniquely determined. The resulting phase diagram sections are useful for understanding the phase relations of complex metamorphic systems and for applications in which it is necessary to establish the variations in rock properties such as density, seismic velocities and volatile-content through a metamorphic cycle. The algorithm has been implemented within a computer program that is general with respect to both the choice of variables and the number of components and phases possible in a system, and is independent of the structure of the equations of state used to describe the phases of the system.},

abstract = {A thermodynamic model calculating the solubility of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in pure water and in aqueous NaCl solutions (0−6 M, 273−500 K, 0−200 bar) is presented. The model is based on a specific particle interaction theory for the liquid phase and a highly accurate equation of state for the vapor phase. With this specific interaction approach, this model is able to predict H2S solubility in other systems, such as H2S−H2O−Na2SO4, H2S−H2O−CaCl2, H2S−H2O−KCl, and H2S−seawater, without fitting experimental data from these systems. Comparison of the model predictions with experimental data indicates that the model is within or close to experimental uncertainty, which is about 7{\%} in H2S solubility. The model is programmed and can be downloaded from the website: www.geochem-model.org/programs.htm. Online calculation is also made available on the website: www.geochem-model.org/models.htm. The H2S solubility model can be used together with numerical speciation-solubility modeling codes such as PHREEQC to calculate sulfide mineral solubility in H2S saturated brines. An example calculation for galena solubility is given.},

abstract = {Operator-splitting (OS) techniques are very attractive for numerical modelling of reactive transport, but they induce some errors. Considering reactive mass transport with reversible and irreversible reactions governed by a first-order rate law, we develop analytical solutions of the mass balance for the following operator-splitting schemes: standard sequential non-iterative (SNI), Strang-splitting SNI, standard sequential iterative (SI), extrapolating SI, and symmetric SI approaches. From these analytical solutions, the operator-splitting methods are compared with respect to mass balance errors and convergence rates independently of the techniques used for solving each operator. Dimensionless times, NOS, are defined. They control mass balance errors and convergence rates. The following order in terms of decreasing efficiency is proposed: symmetric SI, Strang-splitting SNI, standard SNI, extrapolating SI and standard SI schemes. The symmetric SI scheme does not induce any operator-splitting errors, the Strang-splitting SNI appears to be O(N2OS) accurate, and the other schemes are first-order accurate.},

abstract = {CPG (CO2 Plume Geothermal) energy systems use CO2 to extract thermal energy from naturally permeable geologic formations at depth. CO2 has advantages over brine: high mobility, low solubility of amorphous silica, and higher density sensitivity to temperature. The density of CO2 changes substantially between geothermal reservoir and surface plant, resulting in a buoyancy-driven convective current - a thermosiphon - that reduces or eliminates pumping requirements. We estimated and compared the strength of this thermosiphon for CO2 and for 20 weight percent NaCl brine for reservoir depths up to 5km and geothermal gradients of 20, 35, and 50??C/km. We found that through the reservoir, CO2 has a pressure drop approximately 3-12 times less than brine at the same mass flowrate, making the CO2 thermosiphon sufficient to produce power using reservoirs as shallow as 0.5 km. At 2.5 km depth with a 35??C/km gradient - the approximate western U.S. continental mean - the CO2 thermosiphon converted approximately 10{\%} of the energy extracted from the reservoir to fluid circulation, compared to less than 1{\%} with brine, where additional mechanical pumping is necessary. We found CO2 is a particularly advantageous working fluid at depths between 0.5 km and 3 km. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

the strength of the relation between Impact Factors and paper citations has
been decreasing. This decrease began sooner in physics, a field that was
quicker to make the transition into the electronic domain. Furthermore, since
1990, the proportion of highly cited papers coming from highly cited journals
has been decreasing, and accordingly, the proportion of highly cited papers not
coming from highly cited journals has also been increasing. Should this pattern
continue, it might bring an end to the use of the Impact Factor as a way to
evaluate the quality of journals, papers and researchers.},

@article{Glein2013,
abstract = {Saturn's largest moon, Titan, has an atmosphere and surface that are rich in organic compounds. Liquid hydrocarbons exist on the surface, most famously as lakes. Photochemical reactions produce solid organics in Titan's atmosphere, and these materials settle or snow onto the surface. At the surface, liquids can interact with solids, and geochemical processes can occur. The consequences of these processes can be explored using a thermodynamic model to calculate the solubilities of gases and solids in liquid hydrocarbons at cryogenic temperatures. The van Laar model developed in this study was parameterized using experimental phase equilibrium data, and accurately represents the data for the CH4-C2H6-C3H8-N2-C2H2 chemical system from 90 to 110K. The model generally gives more accurate results than existing models. The model also features a suitable balance between accuracy and simplicity, and can serve as a foundation for studies of fluvial geochemistry on Titan because it can be extended to any number of components while maintaining thermodynamic consistency. Application of the model to Titan reveals that the equilibrium composition of surface liquids depends on the abundance of methane gas in the local atmosphere, consistent with prior studies. The concentration of molecular nitrogen in Titan's lakes varies inversely with the ethane content of the lakes. The model indicates that solid acetylene should be quite soluble in surface liquids, which implies that acetylene-rich sedimentary rocks would be susceptible to chemical erosion, and acetylene evaporites may form on Titan. The geochemical character of acetylene in liquid hydrocarbons on Titan appears to be intermediate to those of calcite and gypsum in surface waters on Earth. Specific recommendations are given of observational, experimental, and theoretical work that will lead to significant advancements in our knowledge of geochemical processes on Titan. This paper represents the beginning of a new kind of geochemistry, called cryogenic fluvial geochemistry, with Titan starring as the first example. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Kulik2006,
abstract = {The dual-thermodynamic (DualTh) approach is shown to provide a useful alternative to other methods in: (i) forward modelling of equilibrium speciation, activities, and element partitioning in a heterogeneous system involving several variable-composition phases, such as the aqueous-solid solution system; (ii) estimation of interaction parameters of a non-ideal mixing model from known bulk compositions of coexisting aqueous and solid-solution phases; and (iii) retrieval of unknown stoichiometries and apparent standard chemical potentials of trace solid-solution end-members. Inverse-modelling tasks (ii) and (iii) can be performed when the solid solution of interest is shown experimentally to co-exist with the aqueous phase either in the equilibrium or at the minimum stoichiometric saturation state. DualTh calculations exploit the ability of Gibbs energy minimisation (GEM) algorithms to find simultaneously two numerical solutions of the isobaric-isothermal chemical equilibrium speciation problem: (1) primal solution x - A vector of amounts of components (species) in phases; and (2) dual solution u - A vector of chemical potentials of stoichiometry units (usually chemical elements and charge). Conversely, the chemical potential of a phase component can be found in two complementary ways: (i) primal via its standard-state potential, concentration and activity coefficient (the latter two are functions of the x vector); and (ii) dual through its formula stoichiometry multiplied by the u vector. The DualTh methods compare primal and dual values of the chemical potential in simple and straightforward equations that can be easily computed in a spreadsheet, or implemented in GEM geochemical modelling codes. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The stable computation of linearly constrained, multiphase, chemical equilibrium compositions is an important topic for a wide range of industrial and academic applications. Numerous computational methods have been developed to solve such problems which are, in general, susceptible to failure under certain conditions due to numerical stiffness. In this work, we present a Gibbs function continuation method for linearly constrained multiphase equilibrium calculations. The method converts the nonlinear Element Potential Equations - derived from the minimization of the mixture Gibbs free energy using the Lagrange multiplier technique - into an initial value problem which can be stably integrated through the use of a property of linear least squares solutions. The stability and convergence properties of the proposed method are derived and it is shown that the single phase method arises as a special case of the multiphase algorithm when only one phase is considered. Two test cases are presented to clarify and demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the method.},

@article{Luhmann2013,
abstract = {Carbon sequestration experiments were conducted on uncemented sediment and lithified rock from the Eau Claire Formation, which consisted primarily of K-feldspar and quartz. Cores were heated to accentuate reactivity between fluid and mineral grains and to force CO(2) exsolution. Measured permeability of one sediment core ultimately reduced by 4 orders of magnitude as it was incrementally heated from 21 to 150 °C. Water-rock interaction produced some alteration, yielding sub-$\mu$m clay precipitation on K-feldspar grains in the core's upstream end. Experimental results also revealed abundant newly formed pore space in regions of the core, and in some cases pores that were several times larger than the average grain size of the sediment. These large pores likely formed from elevated localized pressure caused by rapid CO(2) exsolution within the core and/or an accumulating CO(2) phase capable of pushing out surrounding sediment. CO(2) filled the pores and blocked flow pathways. Comparison with a similar experiment using a solid arkose core indicates that CO(2) accumulation and grain reorganization mainly contributed to permeability reduction during the heated sediment core experiment. This suggests that CO(2) injection into sediments may store more CO(2) and cause additional permeability reduction than is possible in lithified rock due to grain reorganization.},

abstract = {This paper considers strategies for selecting the barrier parameter at every iteration of an interior-point method for nonlinear programming. Numerical experiments suggest that adaptive choices, such as Mehrotra's probing procedure, outperform static strate- gies that hold the barrier parameter fixed until a barrier optimality test is satisfied. A new adaptive strategy is proposed based on the minimization of a quality function. The paper also proposes a globalization framework that ensures the convergence of adaptive interior methods. The barrier update strategies proposed in this paper are applica- ble to a wide class of interior methods and are tested in the two distinct algorithmic frameworks provided by the ipopt and knitro software packages.},

Examples using different thermodynamic models are presented as well as problems with energy and kinetic constraints. The results are in good agreement with the literature. The calculation method can be applied to a wide variety of fields. Possible extension of the work to electrochemical systems is also addressed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Recent advances in theoretical geochemistry permit calculation of the standard molal thermodynamic properties of a wide variety of minerals, gases, aqueous species, and reactions from 1 to 5000 bar and 0 to 1000C. The SUPCRT92 software package facilitates practical application of these recent theories, equations, and data to define equilibrium constraints on geochemical processes in a wide variety of geologic systems. The SUPCRT92 package is composed of three interactive FORTRAN 77 programs, SUPCRT92, MPRONS92, and CPRONS92, and a sequential-access thermodynamic database, SPRONS92.DAT. The SUPCRT92 program reads or permits user-generation of its two input files, CON and RXN, retrieves data from the direct-access equivalent of SPRONS92.DAT, calculates the standard molal Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, entropy, heat capacity, and volume of each reaction specified on the RXN file through a range of conditions specified on the CON file, and writes the calculated reaction properties to the output TAB file and, optionally, to PLT files that facilitate their graphical depiction. Calculations can be performed along the liquid side of the H2O vaporization boundary by specifying either temperature (T) or pressure (P), and in the single-phase regions of fluid H2O by specifying either T and P, T and H2O density, T and log K, or P and log K. SPRONS92.DAT, which contains standard molal thermodynamic properties at 25C and 1 bar, equation-of-state parameters, heat capacity coefficients, and phase transition data for approximately 500 minerals, gases, and aqueous species, can be augmented or otherwise modified using MPRONS92, and converted to its direct-access equivalent using CPRONS92.},

abstract = {Pathways for net biochemical reactions can be calculated by using a computer program that solves systems of linear equations. The coefficients in the linear equations are the stoichiometric numbers in the biochemical equations for the system. The solution of the system of linear equations is a vector of the stoichiometric numbers of the reactions in the pathway for the net reaction; this is referred to as the pathway vector. The pathway vector gives the number of times the various reactions have to occur to produce the desired net reaction. Net reactions may involve unknown numbers of ATP, ADP, and Pi molecules. The numbers of ATP, ADP, and Pi in a desired net reaction can be calculated in a two-step process. In the first step, the pathway is calculated by solving the system of linear equations for an abbreviated stoichiometric number matrix without ATP, ADP, Pi, NADred, and NADox. In the second step, the stoichiometric numbers in the desired net reaction, which includes ATP, ADP, Pi, NADred, and NADox, are obtained by multiplying the full stoichiometric number matrix by the calculated pathway vector.},

abstract = {A chemical or biochemical reaction can drive an ion through a semipermeable membrane and set up an electric potential difference that can cause the transport of a different ion through the membrane against its concentration gradient. This article treats the thermodynamics of a system in which an ionic reaction A + B = C drives C through a membrane permeable only to C:. The fundamental equation for the Gibbs energy G leads to a criterion for spontaneous change and equilibrium involving the transferred charge Q as a natural variable. This leads to an extension of the membrane equilibrium equation. It is shown that the number D of natural variables is equal to the number f of independent intensive variables (degrees of freedom) plus the number of phases. Since the charge transferred is not a convenient natural variable from an experimental point of view, a Legendre transform is used to define a transformed Gibbs energy G' that has the potential difference between the phases as a natural variable. This leads to the transformed chemical potential mu(i)' that is related to the chemical potential by mu(i) = mu(i)' + Fz phi(i). Since the chemical potential, which has the same value in phases at equilibrium, is given by mu(i) = mu(i) degrees + RT In a(i)+ Fz phi(i), the transformed chemical potential for i in a multiphase system with potential differences is given by mu(i)' = mu i degrees + RT In a(i).},

abstract = {A thermodynamic database which is consistent with most available phase equilibrium experiments and calorimetric and physical measurements on the solids in the system MgO-FeO-SiO2 is established for the phases with the compositions (Mg, Fe)SiO3 (garnet, perovskite, pyroxene, and ilmenite), (Mg, Fe)2SiO4 (olivine, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ phases), SiO2 (stishovite and coesite), and (Mg, Fe)O (periclase and wustite). The data are systematized by using the high temperature Birch-Murnaghan equation of state which includes the pressure and temperature dependent bulk modulus (K) and temperature dependent thermal expansion ($\alpha$) of the solids. The systematized thermodynamic data contains heat capacity (Cp) data, which is internally consistent with the data on $\alpha$, K, volume, and temperature. Such a systematized database is used to calculate, by the method of minimization of Gibbs free energy, the mineralogical composition of the peridotitic/pyrolitic and chondritic MgO-FeO-SiO2 mantles. The model corresponds closely to the seismological PREM (Preliminary Earth Reference Model) in predicting the major seismic discontinuities. However, such discontinuities resulting from reactions or phase transformation are not as sharp as the seismic ones. Calculated adiabatic geothermal gradient starting at 6 GPa and 1500 K reaches a temperature of 2046 K at the core/mantle pressure (135 GPa) in a pyrolite mantle. The model Earth parameters in the lower mantle are (PREM parameters in bracket): Ks = 308 (306) to 687 (656) GPa; $\phi$ = 70 (69) to 121 (118) km2 s-2.},

The method of mathematical programming was used to achieve consistency of derived properties with phase equilibrium, calorimetric, and volumetric data, utilizing equations that account for the thermodynamic consequences of first and second order phase transitions, and temperature-dependent disorder. Tabulated properties are in good agreement with thermophysical data, as well as being consistent with the bulk of phase equilibrium data obtained in solubility studies, weight change experiments, and reversals involving both single and mixed volatile species. The reliability of the thermodynamic data set is documented by extensive comparisons (Figs. 4–45) between computed equilibria and phase equilibrium data. The high degree of consistency obtained with these diverse experimental data gives confidence that the refined thermodynamic properties should allow accurate prediction of phase relationships among stoichiometric minerals in complex chemical systems, and provide a reasonable basis from which activity models for minerals may be derived.},

@article{Mehrotra1992,
abstract = {Renal, liver, heart and lung transplantation are now considered to be the standard therapeutic interventions in patients with end-stage organ failure. Infectious complications following solid organ transplantation (SOT) are relatively common owing to the transplant recipient's overall immunosuppressed status. The incidence of invasive mycoses following SOT ranges from 5{\%} to 42{\%} depending on the organ transplanted. Moreover, invasive fungal infections (IFIs) account for significant morbidity and mortality in SOT, ranging between 25{\%} and 95{\%} depending on the type of fungus and its organ localisation. The frequency, incidence and clinicoepidemiological characteristics of IFIs in patients who are recipients of non-pulmonary solid organ transplantation (NP-SOT) are very different from those that occur in patients with lung transplantation and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Candida and Aspergillus spp. are the cause of most infections. These fungal infections are associated with high overall mortality rates. Different strategies (prophylaxis, pre-emptive treatment, empirical therapy, antifungal combinations, routes of administration) have been tested to improve the prognosis of these invasive mycoses in SOT. To achieve this objective it is essential to have new antifungal drugs with a higher spectrum of activity against the fungal pathogens, both classical and emerging, and showing improvements in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, ease of administration and acceptability, and lower rates of adverse effects. This article will review the risk factors for IFIs in NP-SOT recipients and the available antifungal strategies for management. In addition, it will evaluate the role of prophylactic therapy in this group of patients.},

abstract = {The heat capacity of natural xenotime-(Y) and synthetic DyPO4 and ErPO4 crystals was determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at temperatures of 298.15 K to 868.15 K and a pressure of 0.1 MPa. The aim of the study was to develop a method to accurately measure the isobaric heat capacity (CP) of rare earth element (REE) phosphates, compare the results to data from adiabatic calorimetric experiments, and evaluate the deviation from ideality of the CP of the natural xenotime-(Y) solid solution. The measured CP data (in J mol-1 K-1) can be described by the relationships: 185.5 - 751.9T-0.5 - 3.261e + 06 T-2 for DyPO4; 207.2 - 1661T-0.5 - 5.289e + 05 T-2 for ErPO4; and 208 - 1241T-0.5 - 2.493e + 06 T-2 for xenotime-(Y); where T is the temperature in K. The heat capacity data for natural xenotime-(Y) were used to determine the excess function for the solid solution, which yields an excess heat capacity ranging between 7.9 and 10.7{\%}, well within the range of the DSC method used in this study. The experiments indicate that xenotime-(Y) forms a non-ideal solid solution. Future DSC studies will provide important data for developing a solid solution model for the incorporation of REE in xenotime-(Y).},

abstract = {We consider the application of the conjugate gradient method to the solution of large equality constrained quadratic programs arising in nonlinear optimization. Our approach is based implicitly on a reduced linear system and generates iterates in the null space of the constraints. Instead of computing a basis for this null space, we choose to work directly with the matrix of constraint gradients, computing projections into the null space by either a normal equations or an augmented system approach. Unfortunately, in practice such projections can result in significant rounding errors. We propose iterative refinement techniques, as well as an adaptive reformulation of the quadratic problem, that can greatly reduce these errors without incurring high computational overheads. Numerical results illustrating the efficacy of the proposed approaches are presented.},

abstract = {Ferrous iron bio-oxidation by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans immobilized on polyurethane foam was investigated. Cells were immobilized on foams by placing them in a growth environment and fully bacterially activated polyurethane foams (BAPUFs) were prepared by serial subculturing in batches with partially bacterially activated foam (pBAPUFs). The dependence of foam density on cell immobilization process, the effect of pH and BAPUF loading on ferrous oxidation were studied to choose operating parameters for continuous operations. With an objective to have high cell densities both in foam and the liquid phase, pretreated foams of density 50 kg/m(3) as cell support and ferrous oxidation at pH 1.5 to moderate the ferric precipitation were preferred. A novel basket-type bioreactor for continuous ferrous iron oxidation, which features a multiple effect of stirred tank in combination with recirculation, was designed and operated. The results were compared with that of a free cell and a sheet-type foam immobilized reactors. A fivefold increase in ferric iron productivity at 33.02 g/h/L of free volume in foam was achieved using basket-type bioreactor when compared to a free cell continuous system. A mathematical model for ferrous iron oxidation by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans cells immobilized on polyurethane foam was developed with cell growth in foam accounted by an effectiveness factor. The basic parameters of simulation were estimated using the experimental data on free cell growth as well as from cell attachment to foam under nongrowing conditions. The model predicted the phase of both oxidation of ferrous in shake flasks by pBAPUFs as well as by fully activated BAPUFs for different cell loadings in foam. Model for stirred tank basket bioreactor predicted within 5{\%} both transient and steady state of the experiments closely for the simulated dilution rates. Bio-oxidation at high Fe(2+) concentrations were simulated with experiments when substrate and product inhibition coefficients were factored into cell growth kinetics.

abstract = {Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) have the potential to make a significant contribution to the world energy inventory. One controversial issue associated with EGS, however, is the impact of induced seismicity or microseismicity, which has been the cause of delays and threatened cancellation of at least two EGS projects worldwide. Although microseismicity has in fact had few (or no) adverse physical effects on operations or on surrounding communities, there remains public concern over the amount and magnitude of the seismicity associated with current and future EGS operations. The primary objectives of this paper are to present an up-to-date review of what is already known about the seismicity induced during the creation and operation of EGS, and of the gaps in our knowledge that, once addressed, should lead to an improved understanding of the mechanisms generating the events. Several case histories also illustrate a number of technical and public acceptance issues. We conclude that EGS-induced seismicity need not pose a threat to the development of geothermal energy resources if site selection is carried out properly, community issues are handled adequately and operators understand the underlying mechanisms causing the events. Induced seismicity could indeed prove beneficial, in that it can be used to monitor the effectiveness of EGS operations and shed light on geothermal reservoir processes. ?? 2007 CNR.},

Instead, a solution to a trust region subproblem is defined by minimizing a quadratic function subject only to an ellipsoidal constraint. The iterates generated are strictly feasible. Our proposed method reduces to a standard trust region approach for the unconstrained problem when there are no upper or lower bounds on the variables. Global and local quadratic convergence is established. Preliminary numerical experiments are reported indicating the practical viability of this approach.},

abstract = {This book was first published in 1970. It addresses the increasing use of digital computers for equilibrium calculations in high temperature, high pressure processes, in rocketry and in explosives technology. It surveys the numerical techniques developed over the fifteen to twenty years preceding its publication. The authors derive the equations describing equilibria in different types of system and outline the effect of variation of the parameters of the system on the equilibrium composition. They discuss critically the available methods of solution of the chemical equilibrium problem, both in the minimization and non-linear equations form, and indicate the factors that should be taken into account in selecting the optimum method of solution for a particular problem and computer. The fundamental chemical and thermodynamic analytic material was selected so as to make the book fully accessible for students of chemical engineering, explosives and technology.},

abstract = {We performed core flooding experiments on Indiana limestone using the porous plate method to measure the amount of trapped CO(2) at a temperature of 50 °C and two pressures: 4.2 and 9 MPa. Brine was mixed with CO(2) for equilibration, then the mixture was circulated through a sacrificial core. Porosity and permeability tests conducted before and after 884 h of continuous core flooding confirmed negligible dissolution. A trapping curve for supercritical (sc)CO(2) in Indiana showing the relationship between the initial and residual CO(2) saturations was measured and compared with that of gaseous CO(2). The results were also compared with scCO(2) trapping in Berea sandstone at the same conditions. A scCO(2) residual trapping end point of 23.7{\%} was observed, indicating slightly less trapping of scCO(2) in Indiana carbonates than in Berea sandstone. There is less trapping for gaseous CO(2) (end point of 18.8{\%}). The system appears to be more water-wet under scCO(2) conditions, which is different from the trend observed in Berea; we hypothesize that this is due to the greater concentration of Ca(2+) in brine at higher pressure. Our work indicates that capillary trapping could contribute to the immobilization of CO(2) in carbonate aquifers.},

However, in many prospective applications, the behaviour of matter is influenced by additional constraining factors, such as kinetic inhibitions, or electrochemical, charge transport as well as surface phenomena. For those situations, an extended Gibbs energy method can be applied. In this technique, the supplementary work-coefficient or affinity related condition is introduced to the Gibbs energy calculation as an additional undetermined Lagrange multiplier, which represents the constraint potential. A number of new phenomena can thus be included in Gibbs'ian calculations. The extended Gibbs energy method is illustrated with some very basic examples.},

abstract = {In this work, we introduce a generalized, global numerical methodology for analysis of binding phenomena in complex macromolecular assemblies. On the basis of a numerical algorithm (EQS) to solve systems of simultaneous free energy equations, binding profiles of simple to highly complex interacting systems can be analyzed over any concentration region without any need to generate an analytical form to describe the data. The output of the numerical algorithm is the concentration of each individual species in solution, allowing the generation of all possible binding profiles of the system (e.g., protein saturation by ligand). We present here the application of this approach to the DNA-protein subunit-ligand interactions of the trp repressor system as a typical example. From a practical point of view, the analysis program is capable of the rapid and simultaneous analysis of multiple binding profiles in terms of internally consistent sets of free energies. Given both the enormous complexity, as well as the underlying subtlety, involved in the regulation of biological function, the present generalized approach to analyzing macro-molecular binding should find wide applications. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

In [J. Nonlin. Sci., to appear], the authors showed that each iteration of the CSP algorithm improves the approximation of the slow manifold by one order. In this paper, it is shown that the CSP method simultaneously approximates the tangent spaces to the fast fibers along which solutions relax to the slow manifold. Again, each iteration adds one order of accuracy. In some studies, the output of the CSP algorithm is postprocessed by linearly projecting initial data onto the slow manifold along these approximate tangent spaces. These projections, in turn, also become successively more accurate.},

A set-theory system of notation is introduced for physicochemical models. Analytical expressions are provided for the chemical potentials of dependent components in symmetric and asymmetric reference states. Necessary and sufficient conditions are formulated for complete and metastable equilibrium using the Kuhn--Tucker conditions of the problem of convex programming, when one- and/or two-sided constraints can be set on part or all sought-for values of mole quantities of dependent components. The prime solution values of the convex programming problem are sought-for values of the molar quantities of dependent components, while the dual solution values are sought- for values of the chemical potentials of independent components of the system related to stoichiometric units. The use of the chemical potentials of independent components allows solving the problem of the determination of the Gibbs free energy of formation of compounds from their known contents in the systems and, vise versa, the concentrations of dependent components in solution phases from the known Gibbs free energies of formation and chemical potentials of independent components in representative subsystems. Dual solutions related to a balance constraint on the electric charge of the system permit explicit calculation of the redox potential of the system, Eh (pe), without considering the partial pressure of oxygen or hydrogen and pH.},

abstract = {Application of the quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) in chemical kinetics allows the concentration of some species (QSSA species) to be calculated not only via the solution of kinetic differential equations but also from the concentration of other species using algebraic equations. The difference in the concentrations of QSSA species obtained from the two calculations, at a single time point, is called the instantaneous QSSA error. This error represents a continuous perturbation of the calculated trajectory and causes an overall error in the concentrations of non-QSSA species as well. Two equations are given for the calculation of the instantaneous error. Initial selection of QSSA species can be based on the first equation, which predicts the instantaneous error of a single species. The second more involved error equation takes into account the interaction of errors of selected species and gives the instantaneous error for a group of QSSA species. Successful application of the QSSA requires that the overall error of important species be small. In some cases a small instantaneous error in the QSSA species can be magnified and results in large overall error. Such “pathological” cases can be detected by the calculation of the initial concentration sensitivity matrix. Those species, which induce large overall error, have to be excluded from the group of the QSSA species. The relation of the QSSA to the lifetime of species and to the stiffness of ODES is also discussed. The use of the error formulas is illustrated by the application of the QSSA for a propane pyrolysis mechanism and briefly for the combustion of H2.},

abstract = {Pore-scale imaging and modelling - digital core analysis - is becoming a routine service in the oil and gas industry, and has potential applications in contaminant transport and carbon dioxide storage. This paper briefly describes the underlying technology, namely imaging of the pore space of rocks from the nanometre scale upwards, coupled with a suite of different numerical techniques for simulating single and multiphase flow and transport through these images. Three example applications are then described, illustrating the range of scientific problems that can be tackled: dispersion in different rock samples that predicts the anomalous transport behaviour characteristic of highly heterogeneous carbonates; imaging of super-critical carbon dioxide in sandstone to demonstrate the possibility of capillary trapping in geological carbon storage; and the computation of relative permeability for mixed-wet carbonates and implications for oilfield waterflood recovery. The paper concludes by discussing limitations and challenges, including finding representative samples, imaging and simulating flow and transport in pore spaces over many orders of magnitude in size, the determination of wettability, and upscaling to the field scale. We conclude that pore-scale modelling is likely to become more widely applied in the oil industry including assessment of unconventional oil and gas resources. It has the potential to transform our understanding of multiphase flow processes, facilitating more efficient oil and gas recovery, effective contaminant removal and safe carbon dioxide storage. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Development of robust and efficient methods for the computation of multiphase systems has long been a challenge in both chemical and petroleum engineering as well as in materials science. Several techniques have been developed, particularly those which apply the Gibbs free energy minimization. In addition to calculation of global equilibrium problems, practical process simulation would benefit from algorithms, where reaction rates could be taken into account. In the present work, the method of Lagrange multipliers has been used to incorporate such additional constraints to the minimization problem, which allow a mechanistic reaction rate model to be included in the Gibbsian multi-component calculation. The method can be used to calculate the thermodynamic properties of a multiphase system during a chemical change. The applications include computational materials science, industrial process modeling with known reaction rates combined with complex heat and mass transfer effects and studies of other nonequilibrium systems. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, the water content of a cement paste is relatively low and the ionic strength of the interstitial solution is often high. These conditions are extreme conditions with respect to the common assumptions made in speciation problem. Furthermore the common trial and error algorithm to find the phase assemblage does not provide any guarantee of convergence. We propose a speciation solver based on a semismooth Newton method adapted to the thermodynamic modeling of cement paste. The strong theoretical properties associated with these methods offer practical advantages. Results of numerical experiments indicate that the algorithm is reliable, robust, and efficient.},

abstract = {The trust region problem, minimization of a quadratic function subject to a spherical trust region constraint, occurs in many optimization algorithms. In a previous paper, the authors introduced an inexpensive approximate solution technique for this problem that involves the solution of a two-dimensional trust region problem. They showed that using this approximation in an unconstrained optimization algorithm leads to the same theoretical global and local convergence properties as are obtained using the exact solution to the trust region problem. This paper reports computational results showing that the two-dimensional minimization approach gives nearly optimal reductions in the n -dimension quadratic model over a wide range of test cases. We also show that there is very little difference, in efficiency and reliability, between using the approximate or exact trust region step in solving standard test problems for unconstrained optimization. These results may encourage the application of similar approximate trust region techniques in other contexts.},

abstract = {Calculations using the aqueous model from WATEQ and an aqueous model modified from WATEQ were compared to experimental mean activity coefficients for various salts to determine the range of applicability and the sources of errors in the models. An ion-association aqueous model was derived by least-squares fitting of ion-association stability constants and individual-ion, activity-coefficient parameters to experimental mean activity coefficients for various salts at 25 C. Salts of the following cations and anions were considered: Al(+3), Ba(+2) , Ca(+2), Cd(+2), Co(+2), Cs(+), Cu(+2), Fe(+2), H(+), K(+), Li( +), Mg(+2), Mn(+2), Na(+), Ni(+2), Pb(+2), Sr(+2), Zn(+2), Cl(-) , ClO4(-), F(-), OH(-), and SO4(-2). The stability constants of the derived model and the WATEQ model were in agreement for most two-ion complexes but were not in agreement for most complexes containing three or more ions. The largest discrepancies in stability constants were for complexes Cu(+2), Mn(+2), Ni(+2), and Zn(+2) with Cl(-). The derived-model calculations matched the experimental data for all salts to a concentration of about 2 molal, but the parameters of the model could not be defined uniquely by the fitting process. Alternative choices for the complexes included in the model and for the individual-ion, activity-coefficient parameters could fit the experimental data equally well.

abstract = {The constrained Gibbs energy method has been developed for the use of immaterial entities in the formula conservation matrix of the Gibbs energy minimization problem. The new method enables the association of the conservation matrix with structural, physical, chemical, and energetic properties, and thus the scope of free energy calculations can be extended beyond the conventional studies of global chemical equilibria and phase diagrams. The use of immaterial constraints enables thermochemical calculations in partial equilibrium systems as well as in systems controlled by work factors. In addition, they allow the introduction of mechanistic reaction kinetics to the Gibbsian multiphase analysis. The constrained advancements of reactions are incorporated into the Gibbs energy calculation by using additional virtual phases in the conservation matrix. The virtual components are then utilized to meet the incremental consumption of reactants or the formation of products in the kinetically slow reactions. The respective thermodynamic properties for the intermediate states can be used in reaction rate formulations, e.g., by applying the reaction quotients.},

@article{Janbozorgi2009,
abstract = {The rate-controlled constrained-equilibrium (RCCE) method for simplifying the kinetics of complex reacting systems is reviewed. This method is based on the maximum entropy principle of thermodynamics and involves the assumption that the evolution of a system can be described using a relatively small set of slowly changing constraints imposed by the external and internal dynamics of the system. As a result, the number of differential and algebraic equations required to determine the constrained-equilibrium state of a system can be very much smaller than the number of species in the system. It follows that only reactions which change constraints are required to determine the dynamic evolution of the system and all other reactions are in equilibrium. The accuracy of the method depends on both the character and number of constraints employed and issues involved in the selection and transformation of the constraints are discussed. A method for determining the initial conditions for highly non-equilibrium systems is also presented. The method is illustrated by applying it to the oxidation of methane (CH4), methanol (CH3OH), and formaldehyde (CH2O) in a constant volume adiabatic chamber over a wide range of initial temperatures, pressures, and equivalence ratios. The RCCE calculations were carried out using 8-12 constraints and 133 reactions. Good agreement with "Detailed Kinetic Model" (DMK) calculations using 29 species and 133 reactions was obtained. The number of reactions in the RCCE calculations could be reduced to 20 for CH4, 16 for CH3OH, and 12 for CH2O without changing the results significantly affecting the agreement. It may be noted that a DKM with 29 species requires a minimum of 29 reactions. ?? 2009 The Combustion Institute.},

abstract = {When temperature, pressure, and the partial pressure of a reactant$\backslash$nare fixed, the criterion of chemical equilibrium can be expressed$\backslash$nin terms of the transformed Gibbs energy G' that is obtained by using$\backslash$na Legendre transform involving the chemical potential of the reactant$\backslash$nthat is fixed. For reactions of ideal gases, the most natural variables$\backslash$nto use in the fundamental equation are T, P', and P(B), where P'$\backslash$nis the partial pressure of the reactants other than the one that$\backslash$nis fixed and P(B) is the partial pressure of the reactant that is$\backslash$nfixed. The fundamental equation for G' yields the expression for$\backslash$nthe transformed entropy S', and a transformed enthalpy can be defined$\backslash$nby the additional Legendre transform H'= G' + TS'. This leads to$\backslash$nan additional form of the fundamental equation. The calculation of$\backslash$ntransformed thermodynamic properties and equilibrium compositions$\backslash$nis discussed for a simple system and for a general multireaction$\backslash$nsystem. The change, in a reaction, of the binding of the reactant$\backslash$nthat is at a specified pressure can be calculated using one of the$\backslash$nsix Maxwell equations of the fundamental equation in G'.},

abstract = {Techniques for the preprocessing of (not-necessarily convex) quadratic programs are discussed.  Most of the procedures extend known ones from the linear to quadratic cases, but a few new preprocessing techniques are introduced.  The implementation aspects are also discussed.  Numerical results are finally presented to indicate the potential of the resulting code, both for linear and quadratic problems.  The impact of insisting that bounds of the variables in the reduced problem be as tight as possible rather than allowing some slack in these bounds is also shown to be numerically significant.},

abstract = {Chemical reactions satisfy element and charge conservation equations, but generally do not satisfy additional independent conservation equations. Biochemical reactions at a specified pH satisfy conservation equations for elements in addition to hydrogen, but they often satisfy additional independent conservation equations because of the coupling of reactions through the enzymatic mechanism. The enzyme may couple together two or more biochemical reactions so that only the sum of the coupled reactions is catalysed. The biochemical reactions that are coupled together may, or may not, share reactants, but the type of coupling discussed here is stoichiometric. Since chemical equations and biochemical equations are mathematical equations, linear algebra provides the means for determining the number and types of constraints involved in the enzymatic mechanism. Constraints in addition to element balances indicate missing reactions. The identification of conservation equations is essential for calculations of equilibrium compositions using computer programs that minimize the transformed Gibbs energy at a specified pH subject to the conservation equations that apply. ?? 1994.},

abstract = {Biochemists need two types of reaction equations, chemical equations in terms of species and biochemical equations in terms of reactants at specified pH and concentrations of free metal ions that are bound by reactant species. Both types of reaction equations have corresponding equilibrium constants, K for chemical reactions and K′ for biochemical reactions. When the pH is specified you enter a whole new world of thermodynamics. There are new thermodynamic properties, new names (transformed thermodynamic properties), and new values, which are quite different, expecially for the standard transformed Gibbs energy. This raises nomenclature problems because it is important to be able to distinguish between chemical equations and biochemical equations at a glance. It is also important to distinguish between the standard thermodynamic properties calculated from K and its temperature coefficient and the standard transformed thermodynamic properties calculated from K′ and its temperature coefficient. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {A method is presented for calculating equilibrium phase assemblages in very nonideal systems. It may be applied to any system for which a thermodynamically consistent model of the free energy which satisfies the usual Maxwell relations and convexity criterion is available. The algorithm minimizes the Gibbs free energy by independently choosing stable reaction directions. The procedure is described in detail and various numerical problems encountered and strategies for dealing with them are discussed. It will be shown that the necessary and sufficient conditions for solution phase selection may be derived from the values of the Lagrange multipliers corresponding to constraints on phases that are not present in the system. The method for evaluating the solution phase Lagrangian multipliers and choosing the optimum composition with which to bring the new solution phase into the system involves a separate constrained minimization problem. This method is sufficiently general so that the correct phase assemblage is chosen free from external control. Special procedures for adding and removing phases including solution phases are also described. ?? 1987.},

@article{Huang2015a,
abstract = {This paper is a continuation of our previous work (Huang and Yong, 2013) for simplifying the Fas signaling-induced apoptotic pathway identified by Hua et al. (2005) for human tumor T cells. The previous paper studied the downstream intracelluar-signaling subsystem, while the present one is concerned with the upstream death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) subsystem. Under the assumption that the bind of Fas-associated death domains and FLICE-inhibitory proteins to the DISC is much faster than that of the initiator procaspases, we greatly simplify the upstream subsystem from 35 reactions with 26 species to 6 reactions with 9 species by adopting the classical and recently justified partial equilibrium approximation method. Numerical simulations show that the simplified model is in an excellent agreement with the original model. Most importantly, the simplified model clearly reveals the key reactants and dominated pathways in the Fas signaling process, and thus provides new insights into the apoptosis.},

abstract = {Quantifying CO2 transport and average effective reaction rates in the subsurface is essential to assess the risks associated with underground carbon capture and storage. We use X-ray microtomography to investigate dynamic pore structure evolution in situ at temperatures and pressures representative of underground reservoirs and aquifers. A 4 mm diameter Ketton carbonate core is injected with CO2-saturated brine at 50 °C and 10 MPa while tomographic images are taken at 15 min intervals with a 3.8 $\mu$m spatial resolution over a period of 2(1/2) h. An approximate doubling of porosity with only a 3.6{\%} increase in surface area to volume ratio is measured from the images. Pore-scale direct simulation and network modeling on the images quantify an order of magnitude increase in permeability and an appreciable alteration of the velocity field. We study the uniform reaction regime, with dissolution throughout the core. However, at the pore scale, we see variations in the degree of dissolution with an overall reaction rate which is approximately 14 times lower than estimated from batch measurements. This work implies that in heterogeneous rocks, pore-scale transport of reactants limits dissolution and can reduce the average effective reaction rate by an order of magnitude.},

abstract = {The propagation of grassland fires is simulated using a fully physical based model, partially developed during the FIRESTAR European Union programme. This approach, based on a multiphase formulation, includes the calculation of the degradation of the vegetation (by dehydration and pyrolysis) and the turbulent/reactive flow resulting from the mixing between the ambient gas (wind flow) and the pyrolizate. The solid fuel is simulated as homogeneous distribution of solid particles forming a porous media, interacting with the gas flow using a continuous distribution of drag forces. Other source terms representing the interactions between the vegetation and the gas flow are also taken into account, such as the production of water vapour and gaseous fuel, the radiation of soot particles and ashes, and the convective exchange in the energy balance. The model was validated from preliminary calculations carried out at small scale, for a homogeneous fuel bed (pine needles, excelsior, sticks) and compared with experimental results obtained in a wind tunnel. Calculations are then extended to study the propagation of fires through a flat grassland, for various wind speed conditions. The numerical results are compared to empirical and semi-empirical predictions obtained in similar conditions.},

abstract = {The rare earth elements (REE) are critical metals that play a major role in emerging high technology and green industries. The light (L)REE occur dominantly in fluorocarbonate minerals and consequently information on the stability of these minerals is essential for a better understanding of the genesis of REE deposits and for the efficient processing of their ores. We have investigated the thermochemical properties of natural bastn??site-(Ce) (Ce0.50La0.25Nd0.20Pr0.05CO3F) and parisite-(Ce) (CaCe0.95La0.60Nd0.35Pr0.10(CO3)3F2) using differential scanning calorimetry at temperatures from 323K to 1022K and a pressure of 1bar employing heat ramping and isothermal methods. Crystal lattice parameters of the REE fluorocarbonate minerals and reaction products from the experiments were determined using X-ray diffraction. The measured isobaric heat capacity (Cp??) for bastn??site-(Ce) can be described by the relationship 134.3-2.032??106T-2 between 343.15 and 528.15K and for parisite-(Ce) by the relationship 398.8-1048T-0.5-4.202??106T-2 between 343.15 and 643.15K, where T is temperature in K. Bastn??site-(Ce) decomposed irreversibly at {\textgreater}612K to form REE oxyfluorides and CO2. An endothermic peak at 824.2K yielded a heat of reaction of 245.2??2.5kJ/mol. Parisite-(Ce) decomposed irreversibly at {\textgreater}664K to form REE oxyfluorides, CaCO3 and CO2. An endothermic peak at 842.7K yielded a heat of reaction of 522.6??5.2kJ/mol. The enthalpy of formation at 298K and 1bar was retrieved from the decomposition enthalpies, yielding -1808.4??12.0kJ/mol and -4848.0??23.8kJ/mol for bastn??site-(Ce) and parisite-(Ce), respectively. The measured molar volumes for bastn??site-(Ce) and parisite-(Ce) are 42.91cm3/mol and 122.71cm3/mol, respectively. An estimation method, based on the dependence of entropy on volume, was used to retrieve the third law entropy (S??) at 298.15K, and together with the measured thermodynamic properties, permitted us to construct the first quantitative mineral-fluid stability diagrams involving bastn??site-(Ce), parisite-(Ce), fluocerite-(Ce), calcite and fluorite at P-T-x conditions relevant for the study of natural Ca-REE-C-O-H-F systems. Further studies of the thermodynamic properties of REE-bearing minerals are urgently needed to better understand the genesis of REE ore deposits.},

abstract = {ECO2N is a fluid property module for the TOUGH2 simulator (Version 2.0) that was designed for applications involving geologic storage of CO2 in saline aquifers. It includes a comprehensive description of the thermodynamics and thermophysical properties of H2O-NaCl-CO2 mixtures, that reproduces fluid properties largely within experimental error for the temperature, pressure and salinity conditions of interest (10 ??C ??? T ??? 110 ??C; P ??? 600 bar; salinity up to full halite saturation). Flow processes can be modeled isothermally or non-isothermally, and phase conditions represented may include a single (aqueous or CO2-rich) phase, as well as two-phase mixtures. Fluid phases may appear or disappear in the course of a simulation, and solid salt may precipitate or dissolve. ECO2N can model super- as well as sub-critical conditions, but it does not make a distinction between liquid and gaseous CO2 and hence is not applicable for processes that involve two CO2-rich phases. This paper highlights significant features of ECO2N, and presents illustrative applications. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {An iterative algorithm is proposed for nonlinearly constrained optimization calculations when there are no derivatives. Each iteration forms linear approximations to the objective and constraint functions by interpolation at the vertices of a simplex and a trust region bound restricts each change to the variables. Thus a new vector of variables is calculated, which may replace one of the current vertices, either to improve the shape of the simplex or because it is the best vector that has been found so far, according to a merit function that gives attention to the greatest constraint violation. The trust region radius $\rho$ is never increased, and it is reduced when the approximations of a well-conditioned simplex fail to yield an improvement to the variables, until $\rho$ reaches a prescribed value that controls the final accuracy. Some convergence properties and several numerical results are given, but there are no more than 9 variables in these calculations because linear approximations can be highly inefficient. Nevertheless, the algorithm is easy to use for small numbers of variables.},

abstract = {Computational methods in chemical equilibrium thermodynamics have found numerous application areas in diverse fields such as metallurgy, petrochemistry, the pulp and paper industry, the study of advanced inorganic materials, environmental science and biochemistry. As many of the cases of interest are not actually in equilibrium, there is a need for methods that extend the application area of multiphase equilibrium solvers to non-equilibrium systems. Likewise there is a need for efficient handling of thermochemical systems that are described by parameters other than those most commonly associated with Gibbs energy, namely temperature, pressure and fixed elemental (and charge) balances. In the work computational methods and related theory are presented that can be used with a standard Gibbs energy minimiser to solve advanced thermochemical problems. The actual calculations have been performed using the ChemSheet software, but the presentation has aimed to be generic and applicable to other thermochemical codes that allow the user to define thermodynamic data and the stoichiometries of the constituent species in the system. The examples discussed include electrochemical Donnan equilibrium (particularly applied to aqueous pulp suspensions), surface and interfacial energies of liquid mixtures, systems affected by external magnetic fields and systems with time-dependent reaction extents and diffusion-constrained paraequilibrium. A number of practical applications have been achieved with the models that combine reaction kinetics with partial thermodynamic equilibrium calculation and ion exchange models based on Donnan equilibrium, that have both been applied with success in real-life industrial design and development work with multicomponent, multiphase systems. The method has been successfully applied to liquid surface energies of systems with multiple components and complex non-equilibrium data.},

Temperature stoichiometric activity coefficients for individual ions can be calculated using deviation functions computed from osmotic coefficients for concentrated NaCl solutions. The results of such calculations, together with computed heat capacities, enthalpies, entropies, and equilibrium constants for many hydrothermal species and reactions are presented in tables and diagrams.},

The method is based on the consecutive exclusion and inclusion of the phases from and into the calculation process till the system is thermodynamically stable with respect to the phases not included in the system. Thermodynamic stability is tested using the Kuhn-Tucker condition. Proof of convergence of the proposed iterative process is given, allowing a test of the validity of Kuhn-Tucker condition to be made.

abstract = {We present in this paper a robust strategy to determine the equilibrium state, in the isobaric-isothermal (NPT) ensemble, of complex multicomponent systems in which solid solutions presenting order/disorder transitions are stable. The algorithm specifically designed to construct the first estimate of the phase assemblage describing the equilibrium state of the system is presented in detail in this work and tested on different binary and ternary systems in which solid solutions are modeled using i) the cluster site approximation or ii) the cluster variation method in the tetrahedron approximation for both the face-centered and body-centered cubic solutions. The performance of the sequential quadratic strategy using an exact Newton method and a linesearch method, implemented in this work for the specific resolution of Gibbs free energy minimization problems, is compared to the one of other large-scale optimization software packages: SNOPT, IPOPT, and KNITRO. Key subroutines implemented in the strategy to locate local minima, and specifically implemented to improve the convergence toward targeted local minima, are also presented in this work and highlight the robustness of our approach.},

@article{Nielsen2013,
abstract = {The concentrations of Sr, Mg and other elements in calcite are widely used to infer the conditions of mineral growth. However, such inferences are dependent on the mechanisms that govern the incorporation of minor constituents into the calcite lattice during growth. A particularly confusing observation is that both Sr and Mg are readily incorporated into growing calcite crystals at low concentrations but inhibit calcite growth at higher concentrations. Here we show that the growth rate dependence of Sr and Mg incorporation into calcite, as well the inhibitory effects on calcite growth of both incorporating and non-incorporating ions, can be predicted with an ion-by-ion crystal growth model where ion attachment is confined to kink sites on the crystal surface.The exchange of ions between active growth (kink) sites on the mineral surface and aqueous solution governs both the efficiency of incorporation of minor constituents and the kinetics of mineral precipitation. Ions such as Sr and Mg in calcite, that are not stoichiometric constituents, may attach to kink sites and impede crystal growth by either blocking propagation of the kink (kink blocking), or if incorporated into the growing mineral, straining the local crystal lattice, and hence increasing the mineral solubility (incorporation inhibition). Here we investigate the effects of including these growth inhibition mechanisms into a microscopic model for crystal growth based on kink creation, propagation and collision (CPC) theory. This model predicts that kink blocking by either incorporated or non-incorporated ions causes an exponential decrease in mineral growth rate with increasing impurity concentration, while incorporation inhibition results in more complicated functional forms of the growth rate effect depending on the thermodynamics of the solid solution. Applying this model to existing data on the partitioning of strontium and magnesium into calcite and the simultaneous effects on growth kinetics and mineral composition, we find that strontium uptake inhibits growth by enhancing mineral solubility while magnesium inhibits growth primarily by kink blocking. Our model should be widely applicable to understanding the impurity content of a large range of sparingly soluble minerals that form by precipitation from aqueous solutions. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper, the term "equilibrium assemblage diagrams" refers to diagrams strictly based on assemblages predicted by Gibbs free energy minimization. The presented Theriak/Domino software uses a unique algorithm of scanning and bookkeeping, which allows to compute completely and automatically a great variety of diagrams: phase diagrams, pseudo-binary, pseudo-ternary, isopleths, modal amounts, molar properties of single phases or bulk-rock properties like total DeltaG, volume of solids, etc. The speed and easiness of use makes thermodynamic modeling accessible to any student of Earth sciences and offers a powerful tool to check the consistency of thermodynamic databases, develop new solution models, plan experimental work, and to understand natural systems. The examples described in this paper demonstrate the capacity of the software, but also to show the usefulness and limitations of computed equilibrium assemblage diagrams. For most illustrations, a metapelite (TN205) from the eastern Lepontine Alps is used. The applications include the interpretation of complex diagrams, mineral reactions, the effect of Al content on the equilibrium assemblages, the interpretation of Si per formula unit in white mica, understanding some features of garnet growth, dehydration and isothermal compressibility, a broadening of the concept of AFM diagrams, combining equilibrium assemblage diagram information with thermobarometry, and comparing the results produced with different databases. Equilibrium assemblage diagrams do not always provide straightforward answers, but mostly stimulate further thought.},

abstract = {The data available in general for an equilibrium calculation are included in the set {\{}A, p*, N, AGO or K, “restrictions”{\}}, where A is the formula matrix for the species involved, p* are the standard chemical potentials or free energies of the species, N is the stoichiometric matrix, AGO and K are the standard free energies and equilibrium constants, respectively, of the reactions contained in N, and “restrictions” represent special constraints. It is shown how any alogrithm (based on free-energy-minimization methods) for computing chemical equilibrium that requires the species-related data set {\{}A, p*) can be used when only the reaction-related data set (N, K) is available (in which case algorithms based on the equilibrium-constant method are frequently used). This situation is common in ionic equilibria. Computational advantages of the free-energy-minimization method can only be exploited if species-related data are available. In addition to the usual case (single phase, “no restrictions”), special cases may arise involving stoichiometric restrictions (e.g., restricted equilibrium), compositional constraints (e.g., fixed pH), or additional phases (e.g., solubility). Examples taken from the literature are used to illustrate these situations. The techniques described, which are not restricted to ionic equilibria, involve converting the data given, and if appropriate, the formula vectors of the species, into standard form for use in the algorithm in the usual way}},

abstract = {Extreme enrichment and postmagmatic hydrothermal mobilization of the rare earth elements (REE), Zr, and Nb have been reported for a number of anorogenic peralkaline intrusions, including the world-class REE-Zr-Nb deposit at Strange Lake, Quebec, Canada. Establishing lithogeochemical vectors for these types of deposits is a challenging task because the effects of hydrothermal processes on element distribution are poorly known and the relationships of alteration types to mineralization stages have not been well documented. Here, we present results of a detailed mineralogical and geochemical investigation involving a dataset of over 500 mineral and bulk-rock analyses of a northeast-southwest section through the potential ore zone at Strange Lake. Based on these data, we develop a model that explains the role of hydrothermal processes in concentrating metals in peralkaline granitic systems and identify lithogeochemical vectors for their exploration. The B zone, located along the northwestern margin of the Strange Lake pluton, contains a lens-shaped, pegmatite-rich domain comprising subhorizontal sheets of pegmatites hosted by granites with a total indicated resource of 278 million tonnes (Mt) grading 0.93 wt {\%} total rare earth oxides (TREO), of which 39{\%} are heavy rare earth elements (HREE). Within this resource, there is an enriched zone containing 20 Mt of ore grading 1.44 wt {\%} TREO, of which 50{\%} are HREE. The pegmatites are characterized by a core enriched in quartz, fluorite, and light rare earth elements (LREE) fluorocarbonates, and a granitic border enriched in zirconosilicates and granitic minerals. The pegmatite sheets and surrounding granites evolved in three essential stages: a magmatic stage (I), a near-neutral hydrothermal stage involving their interaction with NaCl-bearing orthomagmatic fluids (II), and an acidic hydrothermal stage (III, comprising high-[IIIa] and low-temperature [IIIb] substages) that resulted from their interaction with pegmatite-sourced HCl-HF–bearing fluids. Stage IIIa led to pseudomorphic mineral replacement reactions (e.g., Na-Ca exchange during replacement of zirconosilicates) and formation of an aegirinization/hematization halo around the pegmatites. In contrast, stage IIIb, which was responsible for the hydrothermal mobilization of Zr and REE, is manifested by fluorite and quartz veins, zircon spherules, gadolinite-group minerals, gittinsite, ferriallanite-(Ce), and a pervasive replacement of the granite by these minerals. The distribution of REE, Zr, Nb, and Ti was controlled by the competition between hydrothermal fluids and the stability of primary REE-F-(CO2) minerals (e.g., bastn{\"{a}}site-(Ce) host to LREE), zirconosilicates (i.e., Na zirconosilicates and zircon host to HREE and Zr), and Nb-Ti minerals (i.e., pyrochlore host to Nb and narsarsukite host to Ti), and the stability of secondary LREE silicates (i.e., ferriallanite-(Ce)), HREE silicates (i.e., gadolinite-(Y)), zirconosilicates (i.e., gittinsite and zircon), and Nb-Ti minerals (i.e., titanite and pyrochlore). Lithogeochemical vectors were identified to distinguish between the high-temperature acidic alteration (IIIa), using CaO/Na2O (indicator of Ca metasomatism) and Fe2O3/Na2O ratios (indicator of aegirinization/hematization), and the low-temperature acidic alteration (IIIb), using the CaO/Al2O3 ratio (indicator of Ca-F metasomatism). Bulk-rock compositional data show that alteration was accompanied by an enrichment in heavy rare earth oxides (HREO) and ZrO2 at the deposit scale, whereas there was no selective enrichment in the light rare earth oxides (LREO). A 2-D geochemical model of the deposit indicates that the LREO are more dispersed, whereas HREO and ZrO2 are selectively distributed. These variations in LREE/HREE are also reflected in the mineral chemistry, especially in hydrothermal zircon crystals showing an unusual LREE enrichment and HREE depletion, contrasting with pseudomorphs, which are enriched in HREE. Hydrothermal ferriallanite-(Ce) and gadolinite-group minerals also show a clear trend of REE depletion with Ca enrichment. Controlling factors for the hydrothermal mobilization of LREE, HREE, and Zr were temperature, pH, and the availability of fluoride ions (F−) in the fluid for the dissolution of zircon, and chloride ions (Cl−) for the complexation of the REE. The study of rare hydrothermal minerals in conjunction with field observations and the evaluation of variations in bulk-rock composition allowed us to develop a new model for the hydrothermal evolution stage of Strange Lake.},

It employs a Levenberg-Marquardt perturbation to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) matrix to handle indefinite Hessians and a line search to obtain sufficient descent at each iteration. We show that the Levenberg-Marquardt perturbation is equivalent to replacing the Newton step by a cubic regularization step with an appropriately chosen regularization parameter. This equivalence allows us to use the favorable theoretical results of Griewank (1981), Nesterov and Polyak (2006), and Cartis et.al. (2011). Numerical results are provided on a large library of problems to illustrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed approach on both unconstrained and constrained problems.},

The previous paper studied the downstream intracelluar-signaling subsystem, while the present one is concerned with the upstream death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) subsystem. Under the assumption that the bind of Fas-associated death domains and FLICE-inhibitory proteins to the DISC is much faster than that of the initiator procaspases, we greatly simplify the upstream subsystem from 35 reactions with 26 species to 6 reactions with 9 species by adopting the classical and recently justified partial equilibrium approximation method. Numerical simulations show that the simplified model is in an excellent agreement with the original model. Most importantly, the simplified model clearly reveals the key reactants and dominated pathways in the Fas signaling process, and thus provides new insights into the apoptosis.},

abstract = {Reactive mass transport (RMT) simulation is a powerful numerical tool to advance our understanding of complex geochemical processes and their feedbacks in relevant subsurface systems. Thermodynamic equilibrium defines the baseline for solubility, chemical kinetics, and RMT in general. Efficient RMT simulations can be based on the operator-splitting approach, where the solver of chemical equilibria is called by the mass transport part for each control volume whose composition, temperature, or pressure has changed. Modeling of complex natural systems requires consideration of multiphase–multicomponent geochemical models that include nonideal solutions (aqueous electrolytes, fluids, gases, solid solutions, and melts). Direct Gibbs energy minimization (GEM) methods have numerous advantages for the realistic geochemical modeling of such fluid–rock systems. Substantial improvements and extensions to the revised GEM interior point method algorithm based on Karpov's convex programming approach are described, as implemented in the GEMS3K C/C+ + code, which is also the numerical kernel of GEM-Selektor v.3 package (http://gems.web.psi.ch). GEMS3K is presented in the context of the essential criteria of chemical plausibility, robustness of results, mass balance accuracy, numerical stability, speed, and portability to high-performance computing systems. The stand-alone GEMS3K code can treat very complex chemical systems with many nonideal solution phases accurately. It is fast, delivering chemically plausible and accurate results with the same or better mass balance precision as that of conventional speciation codes. GEMS3K is already used in several coupled RMT codes (e.g., OpenGeoSys-GEMS) capable of high-performance computing.},

@article{Gysi2013,
abstract = {Petrological and geochemical observations of pegmatites in the Strange Lake pluton, Canada, have been combined with numerical simulations to improve our understanding of fluid-rock interaction in peralkaline granitic systems. In particular, they have made it possible to evaluate reaction paths responsible for hydrothermal mobilization and mineralization of rare earth elements (REE) and Zr. The focus of the study was the B-Zone in the northwest of the pluton, which contains a pegmatite swarm and is the target of exploration for an economically exploitable REE deposit. Many of the pegmatites are mineralogically zoned into a border consisting of variably altered primary K-feldspar, arfvedsonite, quartz, and zirconosilicates, and a core rich in quartz, fluorite and exotic REE minerals. Textural relationships indicate that the primary silicate minerals in the pegmatites were leached and/or replaced during acidic alteration by K-, Fe- and Al-phyllosilicates, aegirine, hematite, fluorite and/or quartz, and that primary zirconosilicates (e.g., elpidite) were replaced by gittinsite and/or zircon. Reaction textures recording coupled dissolution of silicate minerals and crystallization of secondary REE-silicates indicate hydrothermal mobilization of the REE. The mobility of the light (L)REE was limited by the stability of REE-F-(CO2)-minerals (basn{\"{a}}site-(Ce) and fluocerite-(Ce)), whereas zirconosilicates and secondary gadolinite-group minerals controlled the mobility of Zr and the heavy (H)REE. Hydrothermal fluorite and fluorite-fluocerite-(Ce) solid solutions are interpreted to indicate the former presence of F-bearing saline fluids in the pegmatites. Numerical simulations show that the mobilization of REE and Zr in saline HCl-HF-bearing fluids is controlled by pH, ligand activity and temperature. Mobilization of Zr is significant in both saline HF- and HCl-HF-bearing fluids at low temperature (250°C). In contrast, the REE are mobilized by saline HCl-bearing fluids, particularly at high temperature (400°C). The LREE are more mobile than the HREE in saline HCl-bearing fluids due to the greater stability of LREE-chloride complexes. The simulated mineralogy is consistent with the zonation observed in the pegmatites and with fluid-rock interaction at conditions that were rock-buffered in the pegmatite borders (low fluid/rock ratio; and pH{\textgreater}4) and fluid-buffered in the cores (high fluid/rock ratio; pH≤2). We propose a model in which saline HCl-HF-bearing fluids created pathways during acidic alteration from the pegmatite cores outward. This led to the mobilization of REE and Zr due to progressive alteration of primary silicate minerals and increased acidity upon cooling. The key requirement for REE and Zr mobilization in peralkaline igneous intrusions is the formation of an acidic subsystem with high fluid/rock ratios that increases the overall permeability of the rocks. In these zones, the extent of late stage hydrothermal redistribution and concentration of REE and Zr depends on the buffering capacity of the rocks and the availability of fluids that may produce autometasomatic rock alteration, interact with external rock units and/or mix with fluids from other sources. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The operator-overloading approach to performing reverse-mode automatic differentiation is the most convenient for the user but current implementations are typically 10-35 times slower than the original algorithm. In this paper a fast new operator-overloading method is presented that uses the expression template programming technique in C++ to provide a compile-time representation of each mathematical expression as a computational graph that can be efficiently traversed in either direction. Benchmarking with four different numerical algorithms shows this approach to be 2.6--9 times faster than current operator-overloading libraries, and 1.3--7.7 times more efficient in memory usage. It is typically less than 4 times the computational cost of the original algorithm, although poorer performance is found for all libraries in the case of simple loops containing no mathematical functions. An implementation is freely available in the Adept C++ software library.},

abstract = {Until recently the influence of solution stoichiometry on calcite crystal growth kinetics has attracted little attention, despite the fact that in most aqueous environments calcite precipitates from non-stoichiometric solution. In order to account for the dependence of the calcite crystal growth rate on the cation to anion ratio in solution, we extend the growth model for binary symmetrical electrolyte crystals of Zhang and Nancollas (1998) by combining it with the surface complexation model for the chemical structure of the calcite-aqueous solution interface of Wolthers et al. (2008). To maintain crystal stoichiometry, the rate of attachment of calcium ions to step edges is assumed to equal the rate of attachment of carbonate plus bicarbonate ions. The model parameters are optimized by fitting the model to the step velocities obtained previously by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Teng et al., 2000; Stack and Grantham, 2010). A variable surface roughness factor is introduced in order to reconcile the new process-based growth model with bulk precipitation rates measured in seeded calcite growth experiments. For practical applications, we further present empirical parabolic rate equations fitted to bulk growth rates of calcite in common background electrolytes and in artificial seawater-type solutions. Both the process-based and empirical growth rate equations agree with measured calcite growth rates over broad ranges of ionic strength, pH, solution stoichiometry and degree of supersaturation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The conventional Gibbs energy minimization methods apply elemental amounts of system components as conservation constraints in the form of a stoichiometric conservation matrix. The linear constraints designate the limitations set on the components described by the system constituents. The equilibrium chemical potentials of the constituents are obtained as a linear combination of the component-specific contributions, which are solved with the Lagrange method of undetermined multipliers. When the Gibbs energy of a multiphase system is also affected by conditions due to immaterial properties, the constraints must be adjusted by the respective entities. The constrained free energy (CFE) minimization method includes such conditions and incorporates every immaterial constraint accompanied with its conjugate potential. The respective work or affinity-related condition is introduced to the Gibbs energy calculation as an additional Lagrange multiplier. Thus, the minimization procedure can include systemic or external potential variables with their conjugate coefficients as well as non-equilibrium affinities. Their implementation extends the scope of Gibbs energy calculations to a number of new fields, including surface and interface systems, multi - phase fiber suspensions with Donnan partitioning, kinetically controlled partial equilibria, and pathway analysis of reaction networks.},

abstract = {The FEniCS Project set out in 2003 with an idea to automate the solution of mathematical models based on differential equations. Initially, the FEniCS Project consisted of two libraries: DOLFIN and FIAT. Since then, the project has grown and now consists of the core components DOLFIN, FFC, FIAT, Instant, UFC and UFL. Other FEniCS components and applications described in this book are SyFi/SFC, FErari, ASCoT, Unicorn, CBC.Block, CBC.RANS, CBC.Solve and DOLFWAVE. This book is written by researchers and developers behind the FEniCS Project. The presentation spans mathematical background, software design and the use of FEniCS in applications. The mathe- matical framework is outlined in Part I, the implementation of central components is described in Part II, while Part III concerns a wide range of applications.

abstract = {Reliable assessment and prediction of contaminant fate and transport in the subsurface media requires close collaboration of specialists with expertise in different disciplines such as geology, hydraulics, chemistry, microbiology, environmental science, and mathematics. As the number of disciplines has increased and as each has become more complex and quantitative, the problem of integrating the knowledge and concepts of various specialists into a coherent overall interpretation has become progressively more difficult. To an increasing degree reactive transport simulation has emerged as an answer to this problem, and the reactive transport model has become a vehicle for integrating the inputs of specialists from a variety of backgrounds. Advances in computer hardware and software have led to remarkable increases in the number, variety, and complexity of the processes which can be represented in simulation. Thus the ideas and formulations of different specialists can be combined in a model to generate an overall result, usually a distribution of mass concentration in space and time, which can be compared with observed data to gain a better understanding of the physical, chemical and biological processes that affect contaminant transport and remediation. The growing power of reactive transport simulation to incorporate complex processes and their interactions, and to address such issues as uncertainty, has of course come at the expense of increasingly complex models. More sophisticated solution approaches have been required, the need for ancillary mathematical tools to process and evaluate the results has increased, and in general the potential for numerical difficulty and model misuse has grown. To become an effective and well-informed user of a reactive transport model, one needs to be familiar with the basic theories of flow, transport and geochemical processes, understand the principal ideas behind a particular numerical solution technique and its implications for field applications, and know the limitations and constraints of different numerical models. I am pleased to see that this book will allow the readers to fulfill some of the aforementioned needs. The book is a collection of self-contained papers by the developers of several state-of-the-art and widely used reactive transport models. Each paper describes the development history, mathematical background, numerical techniques, and application case studies of a particular model code. From the descriptions in these papers, the readers will gain useful information and insights to help them make decisions on the suitability of each model code for a particular application. The book will be an invaluable reference text for researchers and students interested in applying multicomponent and multiphase reactive transport modeling to a multitude of geological, hydrological and environmental problems, such as waste disposal, groundwater remediation, groundwater quality management, and carbon sequestration.},

abstract = {The interaction between CO2-rich waters and basaltic glass was studied using reaction path modeling in order to get insight into the water-rock reaction process including secondary mineral composition, water chemistry and mass transfer as a function of CO2 concentration and reaction progress ($\xi$). The calculations were carried out at 25-90°C and pCO2 to 30bars and the results were compared to recent experimental observations and natural systems. A thermodynamic dataset was compiled from 25 to 300°C in order to simulate mineral saturations relevant to basalt alteration in CO2-rich environment including revised key aqueous species for mineral dissolution reactions and apparent Gibbs energies for clay and carbonate solid solutions observed to form in nature. The dissolution of basaltic glass in CO2-rich waters was found to be incongruent with the overall water composition and secondary mineral formation depending on reaction progress and pH. Under mildly acid conditions in CO2 enriched waters (pH {\textless}6.5), SiO2 and simple Al-Si minerals, Ca-Mg-Fe smectites and Ca-Mg-Fe carbonates predominated. Iron, Al and Si were immobile whereas the Mg and Ca mobility depended on the mass of carbonate formed and water pH. Upon quantitative CO2 mineralization, the pH increased to {\textgreater}8 resulting in Ca-Mg-Fe smectite, zeolites and calcite formation, reducing the mobility of most dissolved elements. The dominant factor determining the reaction path of basalt alteration and the associated element mobility was the pH of the water. In turn, the pH value was determined by the concentration of CO2 and extent of reaction. The composition of the carbonates depended on the mobility of Ca, Mg and Fe. At pH {\textless}6.5, Fe was in the ferrous oxidation state resulting in the formation of Fe-rich carbonates with the incorporation of Ca and Mg. At pH {\textgreater}8, the mobility of Fe and Mg was limited due to the formation of clays whereas Ca was incorporated into calcite, zeolites and clays. Competing reactions between clays (Ca-Fe smectites) and carbonates at low pH, and zeolites and clays (Mg-Fe smectites) and carbonates at high pH, controlled the availability of Ca, Mg and Fe, playing a key role for low temperature CO2 mineralization and sequestration into basalts. Several problems of the present model point to the need of improvement in future work. The determinant factors linking time to low temperature reaction path modeling may not only be controlled by the primary dissolving phase, which presents challenges concerning non-stoichiometric dissolution, the leached layer model and reactive surface area, but may include secondary mineral precipitation kinetics as rate limiting step for specific reactions such as retrieved from the present reaction path study. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Accurate prediction of contaminant migration in surface and ground water bodies, including interaction with aquifer and hyporheic zone materials requires reactive transport modeling. The increasing complexity and the procedure-oriented type of programming often used in reactive transport hinder codes reuse and transportability. We present a Fortran 90 module using object-oriented concepts that simulates complex hydrobiogeochemical processes (CHEPROO, CHEmical PRocesses Object-Oriented). CHEPROO consists of a general structure with two classes. The Nodal Chemistry class accounts for the description of local chemistry and geochemical state variables. As such, it provides many functions related to basic operations (evaporation, mixing, etc.) and can easily grow on this direction (extreme dry conditions, biochemical state variables, etc.). The Chemical System class includes kinetic and thermodynamic models that describe reactions between and within phases. As such, it can grow in the direction of increasingly complex chemical systems (solid solutions, microorganisms as individual phases, etc.), without loss in the handling of simple problems. These two classes are overlaid by CHEPROO, a general structure designed for interaction with other codes. CHEPROO can be used as a geochemical tool for the modeling of complex processes such as biodegradation or evaporation at high salinities. However, many functions CHEPROO are devoted to coupling a broad range of chemical processes to other phenomena (flow, transport, mechanical). We have shown that reactive transport (based on either DSA or SIA approaches) could be easily implemented into existing conservative transport code with a minimal number of changes. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Appelo2014,
abstract = {Calculating the solubility of gases and minerals at the high pressures of carbon capture and storage in geological reservoirs requires an accurate description of the molar volumes of aqueous species and the fugacity coefficients of gases. Existing methods for calculating the molar volumes of aqueous species are limited to a specific concentration matrix (often seawater), have been fit for a limited temperature (below 60. ??C) or pressure range, apply only at infinite dilution, or are defined for salts instead of individual ions. A more general and reliable calculation of apparent molar volumes of single ions is presented, based on a modified Redlich-Rosenfeld equation. The modifications consist of (1) using the Born equation to calculate the temperature dependence of the intrinsic volumes, following Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers (HKF), but with Bradley and Pitzer's expression for the dielectric permittivity of water, (2) using the pressure dependence of the extended Debye-H??ckel equation to constrain the limiting slope of the molar volume with ionic strength, and (3) adopting the convention that the proton has zero volume at all ionic strengths, temperatures and pressures. The modifications substantially reduce the number of fitting parameters, while maintaining or even extending the range of temperature and pressure over which molar volumes can be accurately estimated. The coefficients in the HKF-modified-Redlich-Rosenfeld equation were fitted by least-squares on measured solution densities.The limiting volume and attraction factor in the Van der Waals equation of state can be estimated with the Peng-Robinson approach from the critical temperature, pressure, and acentric factor of a gas. The Van der Waals equation can then be used to determine the fugacity coefficients for pure gases and gases in a mixture, and the solubility of the gas can be calculated from the fugacity, the molar volume in aqueous solution, and the equilibrium constant. The coefficients for the Peng-Robinson equations are readily available in the literature.The required equations have been implemented in PHREEQC, version 3, and the parameters for calculating the partial molar volumes and fugacity coefficients have been added to the databases that are distributed with PHREEQC. The ease of use and power of the formulation are illustrated by calculating the solubility of CO2 at high pressures and temperatures, and comparing with well-known examples from the geochemical literature. The equations and parameterizations are suitable for wide application in hydrogeochemical systems, especially in the field of carbon capture and storage. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The knowledge of phase and chemical equilibrium is clearly important in the analysis and design of a wide variety of chemical processes. These problems are described mathematically by complex systems due to the nonlinear nature of the thermodynamic models. This equilibrium state is characterized by the minimization of the Gibbs free energy. Usually, this problem is calculated by using the method of Lagrange multipliers together with the mass balance conditions as necessary subsidiary conditions. However, the convergence is highly dependent of initial estimates of the Lagrange multipliers. The development of robust and efficient methods for the computation of thermodynamic multi-phase systems has long been a challenge in both chemical engineering and materials science. In this context, both heuristic methods, Genetic Algorithms and Differential Evolution, are able to escape from local minima and saddle points. As main disadvantage the high number of objective function evaluations as compared with classic methods can be mentioned. To overcome this disadvantage, this work proposes the dynamic updating of the population size to reduce the number of objective function evaluations. The methodology is applied to determine phase compositions at the chemical equilibrium of real systems. The results demonstrated that the methodology used represents a promising alternative for the problem studied.},

abstract = {The development of highly accurate and computationally efficient modeling software based on Gibbs energy minimization (GEM) makes it possible to thermodynamically simulate geochemically realistic subsurface fluid-rock interaction processes. This involves consideration of non-ideal multicomponent-multiphase systems that include dilute to concentrated aqueous electrolyte solutions, mineral solid solutions, supercritical fluids, silicate and metal melts, and sorption and ion exchange phases. Predicting the stability and thermodynamic properties of non-ideal solution phases over wide ranges of pressures and temperatures requires that theoretically sound and sufficiently accurate equation of state and activity models are used within the GEM framework. The variety of such models calls for a novel, flexible, and computationally efficient code architecture that supports a wide range of models of non-ideal mixing with different mathematical structures and input data. Here, we introduce the TSolMod C++ class library for equation of state and activity models, implemented within the GEMS3K solver of geochemical equilibria as part of the GEM-Selektor code package (http://gems.web.psi.ch). Essential features of the TSolMod library include a generic and flexible model parameter setup, computationally efficient data exchange with the GEM algorithm, and a straightforward extensibility with any new models of mixing. The current version of TSolMod features a comprehensive selection of fluid, gas, liquid, and solid solution models of interest for geochemical, petrological, material science, and chemical engineering applications.},

abstract = {Interior methods are an omnipresent, conspicuous feature of the constrained optimization landscape today, but it was not always so. Primarily in the form of barrier methods, interior-point techniques were popular during the 1960s for solving nonlinearly constrained problems. However, their use for linear programming was not even contemplated because of the total dominance of the simplex method. Vague but continuing anxiety about barrier methods eventually led to their abandonment in favor of newly emerging, apparently more efficient alternatives such as augmented Lagrangian and sequential quadratic programming methods. By the early 1980s, barrier methods were almost without exception regarded as a closed chapter in the history of optimization. This picture changed dramatically with Karmarkar's widely publicized announcement in 1984 of a fast polynomial-time interior method for linear programming; in 1985, a formal connection was established between his method and classical barrier methods. Since then, interior methods have advanced so far, so fast, that their influence has transformed both the theory and practice of constrained optimization. This article provides a condensed, selective look at classical material and recent research about interior methods for nonlinearly constrained optimization.},

The topics presented in this manual are: (1) details for preparing input data sets; (2) a description of output tables for various types of problems; (3) the overall modular organization of the program with information on how to make modifications; (4) a description of the function of each subroutine; (5) error messages and their significance; and (6) a number of examples that illustrate various types of problems handled by CEA and that cover many of the options available in both input and output. Seven appendixes give information on the thermodynamic and thermal transport data used in CEA; some information on common variables used in or generated by the equilibrium module; and output tables for 14 example problems. The CEA program was written in ANSI standard FORTRAN 77. CEA should work on any system with sufficient storage. There are about 6300 lines in the source code, which uses about 225 kilobytes of memory. The compiled program takes about 975 kilobytes.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper presents the development and illustration of a numerical model of reaction-based geochemical and biochemical processes with mixed equilibrium and kinetic reactions. The objective is to provide a general paradigm for modeling reactive chemicals in batch systems, with expectations that it is applicable to reactive chemical transport problems. The unique aspects of the paradigm are to simultaneously (1) facilitate the segregation (isolation) of linearly independent kinetic reactions and thus enable the formulation and parameterization of individual rates one reaction by one reaction when linearly dependent kinetic reactions are absent, (2) enable the inclusion of virtually any type of equilibrium expressions and kinetic rates users want to specify, (3) reduce problem stiffness by eliminating all fast reactions from the set of ordinary differential equations governing the evolution of kinetic variables, (4) perform systematic operations to remove redundant fast reactions and irrelevant kinetic reactions, (5) systematically define chemical components and explicitly enforce mass conservation, (6) accomplish automation in decoupling fast reactions from slow reactions, and (7) increase the robustness of numerical integration of the governing equations with species switching schemes. None of the existing models to our knowledge has included these scopes simultaneously. This model (BIOGEOCHEM) is a general computer code to simulate biogeochemical processes in batch systems from a reaction-based mechanistic standpoint, and is designed to be easily coupled with transport models. To make the model applicable to a wide range of problems, programmed reaction types include aqueous complexation, adsorption-desorption, ion-exchange, oxidation-reduction, precipitation-dissolution, acid-base reactions, and microbial mediated reactions. In addition, user-specified reaction types can be programmed into the model. Any reaction can be treated as fast/equilibrium or slow/kinetic reaction. An equilibrium reaction is modeled with an infinite rate governed by a mass action equilibrium equation or by a user-specified algebraic equation. Programmed kinetic reaction rates include multiple Monod kinetics, nth order empirical, and elementary formulations. In addition, user-specified rate formulations can be programmed into the model. No existing models to our knowledge offer these simultaneous features. Furthermore, most available reaction-based models assume chemical components a priori so that reactions can be written in basic (canonical) forms and implicitly assume that fast equilibrium reactions occur only for homogeneous reactions. The decoupling of fast reactions from slow reactions lessens the stiffness typical of these systems. The explicit enforcement of mass conservation overcomes the mass conservation error due to numerical integration errors. The removal of redundant fast reactions alleviates the problem of singularity. The exclusion of irrelevant slow reactions eliminates the issue of exporting their problematic rate formulations/parameter estimations to different environment conditions. Taking the advantage of the nonuniqueness of components, a dynamic basis-species switching strategy is employed to make the model numerically robust. Backward basis switching allows components to freely change in the simulation of the chemistry module, while being recovered for transport simulation. Three example problems were selected to demonstrate the versatility and robustness of the model. Published 2 April 2003.

abstract = {The Rate-Controlled Constrained-Equilibrium (RCCE) method for the description of the time-dependent behavior of dynamical systems in non-equilibrium states is a general, effective, physically based method for model order reduction that was originally developed in the framework of thermodynamics and chemical kinetics. A generalized mathematical formulation is presented here that allows including nonlinear constraints in non-local equilibrium systems characterized by the existence of a non-increasing Lyapunov functional under the system's internal dynamics. The generalized formulation of RCCE enables to clarify the essentials of the method and the built-in general feature of thermodynamic consistency in the chemical kinetics context. In this paper, we work out the details of the method in a generalized mathematical-physics framework, but for definiteness we detail its well-known implementation in the traditional chemical kinetics framework. We detail proofs and spell out explicit functional dependences so as to bring out and clarify each underlying assumption of the method. In the standard context of chemical kinetics of ideal gas mixtures, we discuss the relations between the validity of the detailed balance condition off-equilibrium and the thermodynamic consistency of the method. We also discuss two examples of RCCE gas-phase combustion calculations to emphasize the constraint-dependent performance of the RCCE method.},

Ionization constants were determined from pH-dependent spectra in the buffer solutions NH3/NH4Cl, NaHCO3/Na2CO3, HCOOH/NaHCOO and NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4. Abstract Variations in the spectra with pH and temperature at constant flow rate were used to determine the first ionization constant of uracil, K1a (uracil), and the first and second acid ionization constants of adenine, K1a (adenine) and K2a (adenine), at ionic strength I = 0.2 mol kg-1 and temperatures up to 200 oC. Time-dependent spectra, obtained by operating the cell as a stopped flow reactor, were used to examine the rate of thermal decomposition as a function of temperature and pH from 200 to 250 oC. Reaction pathways and rate constants were determined by singular value decomposition methods. Uracil and adenine decomposition occurred by one-step and two-step processes, respectively. The kinetic results in the NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 buffer solution are in quantitative agreement with the less-extensive pioneering study by White (Nature 310, 430-432 (1984)), but differ from results in buffers that do not contain phosphate, suggesting that phosphate enhances the thermal stability of nucleic acid bases. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A moderately complex hydrogen-oxygen reaction system is used to demonstrate the application of the Computational Singular Perturbation (CSP) technique. Most of the “insights” normally clained by theoreticians after a successful convenient singular perturbation analysis on “tractable” problems can be obtained for highly complex problems using data generated by CSP, including simplified multi-step reaction models. The basic idea of CSP is that the large number of physically meaningful elementary reactions in a complex reaciion system can be grouped into separate reaction groups each identified with a single characteristic time scale. CSP theory provides an exact algorithm for the determination of this grouping and the reaction rates of earch of the groups, requiring no experience or intuition about the reaction system from the invetigator. terms representing fast reaction groups can simply be discarded when they are exhausted to yield simplified models of the reaction system as a function of time. Examples are given to show how physically meaningful information about the reaction system can be derived when relevant CSP data are available. Sample calculations are performed for the hydrogen-oxygen reaction system at 16]]° K and low pressure CSP. Examination of the CSP data suggests that, when [H], [O], [OH], [H2O], and [HO2] are present initially only in trace amounts, the reaction system can be represented reasonably accurately by a single set of 5 reaction groups (two extremely fast, two moderately fast, and one extremely slow) over an extended time period. Depending on the interest of the invetigator, different simplified multi-step reaction models can be derived to represent the full kinetics formulation.},

abstract = {An algorithm for the construction of phase diagram sections is formulated that is well suited for geodynamic problems in which it is necessary to assess the influence of phase transitions on rock properties or the evolution and migration of fluids. The basis of the algorithm is the representation of the continuous compositional variations of solution phases by series of discrete compositions. As a consequence of this approximation the classical non-linear free energy minimization problem is trivially solved by linear programming. Phase relations are then mapped as a function of the variables of interest using bisection to locate phase boundaries. Treatment of isentropic and isothermal phase relations involving felsic and mafic silicate melts by this method is illustrated. To demonstrate the tractability of more complex problems involving mass transfer, a model for infiltration driven-decarbonation in subduction zones is evaluated. As concluded from earlier closed system models, the open-system model indicates that carbonates are likely to persist in the subducted oceanic crust beyond sub-arc depths even if the upper section of the oceanic mantle is extensively hydrated. However, in contrast to more simplistic models of slab devolatilization, the open-system model suggests slab fluid production is heterogeneous and ephemeral. Computed seismic velocity profiles, together with thermodynamic constraints, imply that for typical geothermal conditions serpentinization of the subducted mantle is unlikely to extend to {\textgreater} 25 km depth and that the average water-content of the serpentinized mantle is {\textless} 2 wt.{\%}. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {An algorithm is described for the calculation of equilibrium compositions of multiple highly nonideal liquid and solid solutions, as well as pure stoichiometric phases, coexisting with a mixture of ideal gas species at fixed temperature and pressure. The total Gibbs free energy of the system is approximated as a quadratic function of the compositions of the gas phase and stable condensed phases, in an orthogonal basis set of pure elements. Only changes in thermal energy and energy related to pressure-volume work are considered. The total Gibbs energy is minimized directly by use of both the slope and the curvature of the Gibbs energy surface with respect to the gas and condensed phase compositions in the basis elements. The algorithm described has been implemented in a computer code for the calculation of condensation sequences for cosmic nebular gases enriched in dust. Machine, compiler and library requirements for performing these calculations in the C programming language are compared. {\textcopyright} 2000 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.

abstract = {A review with 23 refs. Legendre transforms are used to introduce intensive variables as natural variables in the fundamental equations of thermodn. Natural variables are important because when a thermodn. potential can be detd. as a function of its natural variables, all the other thermodn. properties of the system can be obtained by taking partial derivs. It is usually more convenient to use thermodn. potentials that have intensive natural variables because they are often easily controlled than the conjugate extensive variables. This is illustrated for chem. reaction systems in which it is of interest to specify the chem. potential of a species (for example, the pH in a biochem. system). Since the elec. potentials of phases in a multi-phase system are not natural variables of the Gibbs free energy, it is useful to define a transformed Gibbs free energy, for which elec. potentials of phases are natural variables. The use of a Legendre transform brings in a new set of thermodn. properties, new Maxwell equations, Gibbs-Duhem equations, and Gibbs-Helmholtz equations. [on SciFinder (R)]},

@article{Evans2005,
abstract = {A high-rate injection of 20 000 m3 of water into granite between 2.8 and 3.4 km depth at the Soultz hot dry rock (HDR) test site in France in 1993 September led to a 200-fold increase in borehole transmissivity and produced a subvertical cloud of microseismicity of dimensions 0.5 km wide, 1.2 km long, 1.5 km high and oriented 25◦ NW. The resulting data set is unusually complete and well suited to studying permeability creation/enhancement processes in crys- talline rock and the utility of microseismic data for revealing them. Although the microseismic cloud defined using joint hypocentre determination (JHD) locations was diffuse and showed little structure, application of the collapsing method showed it to be composed largely of dis- crete tubes and planes that propagated coherently. One prominent structure that extended 350 m downwards from the vicinity of a flow inlet early in the injection and that appears to contain a major flow path was subjected to detailed investigation to establish its hydrogeologic nature and the mechanisms underpinning its inferred permeability enhancement. High-resolution mi- croseismic mapping techniques (i.e. multiplets and clustering) showed it to be a subvertical, NNW–SSE striking, fracture zone of width 10–20 m. The strike and scale of the structure identifies it as a member of a family of hydrothermally altered, cataclastic shear structures that constitute the primary permeable paths for fluid migration within the rock mass, both under ambient and forced fluid flow conditions. The microseismicity occurred on subvertical, small- scale fractures within the cataclastic shear zone whose azimuths scatter within 22◦ of parallel to the parent structure. Although the structure is likely to have been naturally permeable to some degree, its permeability appears to have been significantly enhanced as a consequence of the injection. The most likely mechanism of permeability enhancement, which is in accord with the strong preference for the microseismicity to grow downwards, involves strike-slip shearing, which produced the opening of vertical tubes at along-strike jogs in the fault (the so-called Hill mesh). Seismic moment release averaged over the structure suggests shear displacements of at least 0.3 mm occurred, which are sufficient to generate aperture changes that are hydraulically significant. The preponderance of discrete structures within the microseismic cloud after col- lapsing suggests that significant flow and permeability enhancement (i.e. stimulation) within the rock mass is largely confined to the interiors of shear zones that appear to have a spacing of approximately 100 m.},

abstract = {Nonlinear reactive transport problems can be solved using the Operator Splitting (OS) approach, where transport and reaction processes are separated or the Direct Substitution Approach (DSA) where chemical and transport equations are solved simultaneously. The OS techniques can be very attractive, but are known to introduce splitting errors with SNIA (Non Iterative OS) and have low convergence rate with SIA (Iterative OS). These problems are avoided with DSA which is more robust than OS schemes. On the other hand, DSA is more complicated and very demanding in terms of computing time and memory requirements. This can make DSA less efficient than OS schemes especially for fine discretizations and chemically simple problems. In this work, DSA, SIA and SNIA are combined with a new sparse direct (unifrontal/multifrontal) solver. The efficiency of this solver is not dependent on the matrix conditioning. The performance of the three approaches is studied for two transport problems with simple and difficult chemical reactions and for different number of unknowns. Results show that when combined with an efficient sparse direct solver, DSA is more efficient than SIA and SNIA even for chemically simple problems and large number of unknowns.},

abstract = {Flow through fractures is often idealized as flow between two parallel plates (plane Poiseuille flow). The opening or aperture between parallel plates is unambiguous and its relation to flowrate is well known. However, fractures in rock have uneven walls and a variable aperture. A model for flow in a frac- ture is proposed wherein the fracture is represented by a set of parallel plate openings with different aper- tures. The model leads to a modified Poiseuille equation for flow which includes an aperture frequency distribution for the fracture. Any arbitrary aperture distribution can be used; in order to simplify compu- tation and demonstrate the properties of the model a log normal form of distribution is assumed. Even when an analytical form of the distribution is assumed, two parameters, rather than a single value repre- senting 'aperture size' are required to determine flowrate. Models of aperture change for a fracture un- dergoing compression (fracture walls deforming) and extension (fracture walls separating) are developed which constrain the additional parameter and allow calculation of flowrate as a function of mean aper- ture. The theoretical relationships developed between mean aperture and flowrate can be used to inter- pret published laboratory data for single fractures},

abstract = {The Gibbs energy minimization encompasses active use of the chemical potentials (partial molar Gibbs energies) of the constituents of the system. Usually, these appear at their equilibrium values as a result of the minimization calculation, the mass balance constraints being the necessary subsidiary conditions. Yet, there are several such physico-chemical circumstances where the system is also constrained by other factors, such as surface effects, potential fields or even by chemical reaction kinetics. In this paper a particular method is presented by which constrained chemical potentials can be applied in a multi-phase Gibbs energy minimization. The constrained potentials arise typically from work-related thermodynamic displacements in the system. When Gibbs energy minimization is performed by the Lagrange method, these constraints appear as additional Lagrangian multipliers. Examples of the constrained potential method are presented in terms of the electrochemical Donnan equilibria in aqueous systems containing semi-permeable interfaces, the phase formation in surface-energy controlled systems and in systems with affinities controlled by chemical reaction kinetics. The methods have been applied successfully in calculating distribution coefficients for metal ions together with pH-values in pulp suspensions, in the calculation of surface tension of alloys, and in thermochemical process modeling involving chemical reaction rates. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

It was carried out during Phase 1 of the Sachplan; starting in 2008, it was completed in 2009 with the implementation of the electronic versions of the PSI/Nagra TDB 12/07. The update is mainly based on the OECD NEA's book series on “Chemical Thermodynamics” and has considered the volumes that appeared after publication of the Nagra/PSI TDB 01/01, namely the four volumes concerning the chemical thermodynamics of Ni, Se, Zr, and Th, as well as the update volume on U, Np, Pu, Am and Tc. In addition, thermochemical data for Si compounds and complexes have been the subject of a thorough in-house review. The present report is a supplement to the documentation of the Nagra/PSI TDB 01/01 and replaces the chapters on the data selection for U, Np, Pu, Am, Cm, Tc, Ni, Se, Zr, Th, and Si. All other data contained in the Nagra/PSI TDB 01/01 have been adopted without any change and are not further discussed. Thus, e.g., the data concerning Al, Eu, Pd and Sn that were the subject of extensive in-house reviews for the preparation of the Nagra/PSI TDB 01/01 remain unchanged. As in the NEA review volumes and the Nagra/PSI TDB 01/01, the specific ion interaction theory (SIT) was used to extrapolate experimental data to zero ionic strength. In the documentation of the Nagra/PSI TDB 01/01, however, the SIT coefficients were in most cases not explicitly reported. For the present update, special care was given to the description of how the relevant SIT coefficients were obtained and the selected values are all tabulated. For the application of SIT to environmental systems where the salinity is governed by NaCl, an estimation method was developed to fill the numerous gaps in the set of experimentally determined SIT coefficients in NaCl background media.},

abstract = {A set of four reactive flow-through experiments at temperature T = 100????C and total pressure P = 12??MPa was performed in limestone reservoir samples. By using various ranging from 0.7 to 10??MPa, these experiments mimic mass transfers occurring (1) near the injection well, where the brine is almost saturated with CO2 (i.e. PCO2 ??? P), and (2) at increasing distances from the injection well, where the fluid displays lower values and higher divalent cation concentrations due rock dissolution along the fluid pathway. Results for PCO2 = 10??MPa show non-uniform dissolution features associated with transport-controlled mass transfer, while reaction-controlled uniform dissolution is observed for PCO2 = 2.5??MPa. The experiment with PCO2 = 6??MPa allows investigating in detail the transition from transport- to reaction-controlled dissolution. Conversely, the experiment reproducing conditions far from the injection well (PCO2 = 0.7??MPa), shows a decrease of porosity triggered by the precipitation of Mg-rich calcite. For all the dissolution experiments, the time-resolved porosity ??{\{}symbol{\}}(t) can be modeled by a simple non-linear equation including parameters that characterise the dissolution regime triggered by the reactivity of the inlet fluid (measured by the Damk??hler number, Da). Furthermore, all dissolution experiments display power scaling between permeability (k) and porosity (??{\{}symbol{\}}) with distinctly different scaling exponents characterising the reactivity of the fluid percolating the sample, independently from the decrease with time of the reactive surface area. It is shown also that dissolution at moderate positive values of Da seems the most efficient to increase permeability and promote a rapid spreading of the reaction front, while inducing minimal modification of the porosity in the vicinity of the CO2 injection well. These results can be used to parameterize the k-??{\{}symbol{\}} function for modeling the earliest dissolution processes occurring in the vicinity of the reaction front. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The problem of chemical mass transfer-calculation of complete and/or restricted chemical equilibrium states in multiphase and multiaggregate systems-is reduced to the convex programming problem. A related set-theory notation is introduced for complex physico-chemical models. It is used to represent the explicit analytical expressions for chemical potentials of species or dependent components both in symmetric and asymmetric reference scales. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the complete and metastable equilibrium states are formulated as Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the convex programming problem, including one-or two-sided restrictions that may be imposed on some or all sought-for molar quantities of dependent components, Such restrictions permit to simulate the metastable the states for individual. species, phases, and subsystems in the system under study. The chemical equilibrium problem is solved both for prime variables (sought-for molar quantities of dependent components) and dual variables (sought- for values of chemical potentials of stoichiometric units, or independent components, in the system). An Interior Points Method (IPM) algorithm is an efficient tool for Gibbs free energy numerical minimization regarding one-and two-sided restrictions without increase in the dimensionality of the iterational equations system of the order defined by the number of independent components, By means of the same algorithm, a feasible initial approximation can always be computed automatically from the entire list of dependent components that may be potentially present in equilibrium, The approach to the global minimum point is explicitly identified when the necessary and sufficient Kuhn-Tucker conditions are met, The minimization of total Gibbs free energy in highly nonideal systems is made persistent and fast by introducing a smoothing parameter that restricts increments of activity coefficients of dependent components as functions of system composition between subsequent iterations of IPM. Theoretical considerations are illustrated by numerical examples. The calculation of total equilibrium in the highly non-ideal case is presented for a very rigid system including silicate melt Parametric minimization of Helmholtz potential under conditions of total and restricted equilibria is shown by an example of the system containing aqueous solution, gas phase, liquid hydrocarbon mixture, and solid carbon.},

The basic properties of laminar flames are first presented along with the major tools developed for modeling turbulent combustion. The links between the available closures are illuminated from a generic description of modeling tools. Then, examples of numerical models for mean burning rates are discussed for premixed turbulent combustion. The use of direct numerical simulation (DNS) as a research instrument is illustrated for turbulent transport occurring in premixed combustion, gradient and counter-gradient modeling of turbulent fluxes is addressed. Finally, a review of the models for non-premixed turbulent flames is given. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Injection into geological formations is a technical option for decreasing carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere. Several key factors influence the performance and long-term integrity of injection into deep saline formations. Accurate representations of the physical properties of carbon dioxide have compiled and use to determine the theoretical storage density at typical sub-surface conditions, and the amount of energy that would be expended in injecting the carbon dioxide (whether pure or mixed with other gases), leading to an estimate of the net reduction of emissions. Detailed computer simulations indicate that the distribution of the injected carbon dioxide is initially dominated by gravity segregation, relative permeability effects and the permeability anisotropy of the saline formation. Post-injection, important effects occur which are not taken into account in conventional petroleum reservoir simulation. Convective mixing is predicted to occur, which greatly accelerates the dissolution of carbon dioxide in the saline formation water. This unusual phenomenon arises from the increase in the density of brine when saturated with carbon dioxide. Complete dissolution of the injected carbon dioxide is predicted to occur over hundreds to thousands of years, depending significantly on the vertical permeability of the formation and the geometry of the top seal. Reactions between the carbonated water and the formation also increase the rate of dissolution. If the chosen site is not a structural trap but a gently dipping regionally extensive formation, then the carbon dioxide can migrate up to tens of kilometres from the injection site, depending on the angle of dip and the horizontal permeability. However, convection and dissolution can still keep the carbon dioxide confined. This theoretical analysis has been developed as part of the Australian Petroleum CRC's GEODISC program, and is being used to assess the suitability of proposed sites for carbon dioxide sequestration. Introduction Projected emissions of “greenhouse gases”, principally carbon dioxide, are predicted to cause significant changes in average global temperature and sea-levels1, which could have negative consequences for people in many parts of the world. Scenarios for stabilising atmospheric carbon dioxide at reasonable levels will eventually require substantial cuts in overall emissions over the next few decades1,2. If usage of fossil fuels is to continue at current levels while avoiding undesirable climate change, technical means need to be found to reduce the carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere in the production and consumption of fossil fuels. One possible solution is to store or "sequester" CO2 emissions in a form where they will not reach the atmosphere. A large industrial source, such as a natural gas processing plant or power station, might produce 107 to 109 kg of CO2 per year over the operating life of the facility. The only disposal options that appear to have sufficient capacity are either the deep ocean or underground3. The latter option can encompass a variety of situations e.g. depleted oil and gas reservoirs, in which CO2 can be used for enhanced recovery, deep unmineable coal seams, where the CO2 can be stored while enhancing methane production, or deep saline formations. The latter option is particularly suitable in the Australian context, since sites with large sequestration capacity can be identified in most of Australia's petroliferous sedimentary basins4, and so the focus of this paper is on sequestration in deep saline formations.},

@article{Tutolo2014a,
abstract = {Internal consistency of thermodynamic data has long been considered vital for confident calculations of aqueous geochemical processes. However, an internally consistent mineral thermodynamic data set is not necessarily consistent with calculations of aqueous species thermodynamic properties due, potentially, to improper or inconsistent constraints used in the derivation process. In this study, we attempt to accommodate the need for a mineral thermodynamic data set that is internally consistent with respect to aqueous species thermodynamic properties by adapting the least squares optimization methods of Powell and Holland (1985). This adapted method allows for both the derivation of mineral thermodynamic properties from fluid chemistry measurements of solutions in equilibrium with mineral assemblages, as well as estimates of the uncertainty on the derived results. Using a large number of phase equilibria, solubility, and calorimetric measurements, we have developed a thermodynamic data set of 12 key aluminum-bearing mineral phases. These data are derived to be consistent with Na+ and K+ speciation data presented by Shock and Helgeson (1988), H4SiO4(aq) data presented by Stef{\'{a}}nsson (2001), and the Al speciation data set presented by Tagirov and Schott (2001). Many of the constraining phase equilibrium measurements are exactly the same as those used to develop other thermodynamic data, yet our derived values tend to be quite different than some of the others' due to our choices of reference data. The differing values of mineral thermodynamic properties have implications for calculations of Al mineral solubilities; specifically, kaolinite solubilities calculated with the developed data set are as much as 6.75 times lower and 73{\%} greater than those calculated with Helgeson et al. (1978) and Holland and Powell (2011) data, respectively. Where possible, calculations and experimental data are compared at low T, and the disagreement between the two sources reiterates the common assertion that low-T measurements of phase equilibria and mineral solubilities in the aluminum system rarely represent equilibrium between water and well-crystallized, aluminum-bearing minerals. As an ancillary benefit of the derived data, we show that it may be combined with high precision measurements of aqueous complex association constants to derive neutral species activity coefficients in supercritical fluids. Although this contribution is specific to the aluminum system, the methods and concepts developed here can help to improve the calculation of water-rock interactions in a broad range of earth systems. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The interpolated boundary conditions are capable of simulating surface reactions and dissolution at both stationary and moving solid-fluid and fluid-fluid interfaces. Results obtained with the boundary conditions are compared to analytical solutions for first-order and constant-flux kinetic surface reactions in a one-dimensional half space, as well as to the analytical solution for evaporation from the surface of a cylinder. Excellent agreement between analytical and simulated results is obtained for a wide range of diffusivities, lattice velocities, and surface reaction rates. The boundary model's ability to represent dissolution in binary fluid mixtures is demonstrated by modeling diffusion from a rising bubble and dissolution of a droplet near a flat plate.},

This algorithm can be combined with any routine integrating the governing equations of the given system to construct programs capable of simulating the evolution of the system using fully rate controlled, partially equilibrated, or fully equilibrated chemistry as required. This is illustrated here by combining this algorithm with an ordinary differential equation solver and using the resulting one-dimensional flow program to predict the quenching of CO in cooled combustion streams, using partial equilibrium chemistry.},

(1) identification of the saturation conditions and likely compositions of a suite of phases relative to a pervasive fluid phase, and 2. (2) detection of phase separation within a homogeneous phase and estimation of compositions in the resulting equilibrium multiphase assemblage. New algorithms are described which address both of these problems in multicomponent thermodynamic systems and numerical results are presented for two and three component cases. An appendix illustrates a method of deriving analytical expressions for derivatives of the Gibbs free energies of phases characterized by internal "ordering" parameters. ?? 1994.},

@article{Fredd1999,
abstract = {SummaryThe effects of transport and reaction on the phenomenon of wormhole formation were investigated for a wide range of fluid systems including strong acids, weak acids, and chelating agents. These fluid systems are influenced by a variety of transport and reaction processes such as the transport of reactants to the surface, the reversible surface reactions, and the transport of products away from the surface. When these transport and reaction processes are taken into account, a common dependence of the dissolution phenomenon on the Damko¨hler number is observed. There exists an optimum Damko¨hler number at which a minimum number of pore volumes are required for channel breakthrough. This optimum Damko¨hler number occurs at approximately 0.29 for all the fluid/mineral systems investigated in this study. In addition, an optimum kinetic parameter exists at which wormhole formation is most efficient. This optimum kinetic parameter occurs at a value of about 130. Together, the Damko¨hler number and the kinetic parameter provide a complete description of the dissolution phenomenon. IntroductionThe flow and reaction of reactive fluids in carbonate porous media results in the formation of highly conductive flow channels, commonly referred to as wormholes. These wormholes form because of rapid rates of dissolution and a large percentage of the mineral being dissolvable in the reactant. The structure of the wormhole channels is strongly dependent upon the rates of mass},

abstract = {The objective of this case study was to obtain some first-hand information about the functional consequences of a cosmetic tongue split operation for speech and tongue motility. One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

abstract = {We present a robust and efficient method for calculating chemical equilibria of general multiphase systems. The method is based on a stoichiometric approach, which uses Newton's method to solve a system of mass-action equations coupled with a system of equilibrium constraints. A stabilisation procedure is developed to promote convergence of the calculation when a presupposed phase in the chemical system is absent in the equilibrium state. The formulation of the chemical equilibrium problem is developed by presuming no specific details of the involved phases and species. As a consequence, the method is flexible and general enough so that the calculation can be customised with a combination of thermodynamic models that are appropriate for the problem of interest. Finally, we show the use of the method to solve relevant geochemical equilibrium problems for modelling carbon storage in highly saline aquifers. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {An approach is suggested for computation of complete or metastable equilibrium states in the multicomponent, multiphase, and multiaggregate systems with parameters of state other than fixed temperature T and pressure P. It consists in computation of a series of isobaric-isothermal equilibrium states by Gibbs energy minimization. Thus, the general problem of minimization of thermodynamic potentials other than Gibbs energy G(T,P) is reduced to a sequence of simpler problems of two- or three-criteria parametric minimization of either of five thermodynamic potentials [isochoric-isothermal or Helmholtz energy A(T,V); isochoric-isentropic or internal energy at isochoric conditions U(S,V); isobaric-isentropic or enthalpy H(P,S); negative entropy at isobaric conditions and fixed enthalpy −S(P,H); and negative entropy at isochoric conditions and fixed internal energy −S(V,U)]. The computational scheme is simple, efficient, and reliable, because in any case it uses the IPM (Interior Points Method) algorithm for searching minimum of the non-linear total Gibbs energy function whereby one- or two-sided restrictions may be imposed on some or all dependent components in the system (Karpov and others, 1997). The new approach provides a rigorous basis for the formulation and numerical solution of the problems of chemical mass transfer under factors of state other than isobaric-isothermal. The developed algorithms and their implementation in Selektor-C program package can be used in a wide variety of scientific and practical applications. The numerical tests and examples illustrate the new technique on a model of irreversible oil-water interaction in hydrocarbon reservoirs (system Ca-Mg-C-O-H).},

abstract = {A general algorithm for the computation of chemical equilibria in complex systems containing non-ideal solutions has been developed. The method is a G-minimization based on repeated linear and nonlinear programming steps. A computer program (THERIAK) based on this algorithm has been written and was used to solve a great variety of problems, ranging from a simple blast furnace calculation to liquid-liquid unmixing in a four component silicate melt. The computing times are in the magnitude of 1 2 to 2 seconds for each calculation. The method can also be used to test the consequences of thermodynamic models and data in systems of interest to many fields, including chemistry, geochemistry and metallurgy. ?? 1987.},

@article{Curtis2015,
abstract = {The relative importance index (RII) method for determining appropriate target species for dynamic adaptive chemistry (DAC) simulations using the directed relation graph with error propagation (DRGEP) method is developed. The adequacy and effectiveness of this RII method is validated for two fuels: n-heptane and isopentanol, representatives of a ground transportation fuel component and bio-alcohol, respectively.The conventional method of DRGEP target species selection involves picking an unchanging (static) set of target species based on the combustion processes of interest; however, these static target species may not remain important throughout the entire combustion simulation, adversely affecting the accuracy of the method. In particular, this behavior may significantly reduce the accuracy of the DRGEP-based DAC approach in complex multidimensional simulations where the encountered combustion conditions cannot be known a priori with high certainty. Moreover, testing multiple sets of static target species to ensure the accuracy of the method is generally computationally prohibitive. Instead, the RII method determines appropriate DRGEP target species solely from the local thermo-chemical state of the simulation, ensuring that accuracy will be maintained. Further, the RII method reduces the expertise required of users to select DRGEP target species sets appropriate to the combustion phenomena under consideration.Constant volume autoignition simulations run over a wide range of initial conditions using detailed reaction mechanisms for n-heptane and isopentanol show that the RII method is able to maintain accuracy even when traditional static target species sets fail, and are even more accurate than expert-selected target species sets. Additionally, the accuracy and efficiency of the RII method are compared to those of static target species sets in single-cell engine simulations under homogeneous charge compression ignition conditions. For simulations using more stringent DRGEP thresholds, the RII method performs similarly to that of the static target species sets. With a larger DRGEP threshold, the RII method is significantly more accurate than the static target species sets without imposing significant computational overhead.Furthermore, the applicability of the RII method to a DRG-based DAC scheme is discussed.},

abstract = {Speciation is the process of evaluating the concentrations of all the species in a chemical system from equilibrium conditions and measured data such as total concentrations of components, electrical conductivity, pH, redox potential or gas partial pressure. It is essential for analyzing geochemical data and defining the chemical composition of waters for geochemical modeling problems like evaluating the chemical composition of evaporating, diluting, mixing waters or reactive transport. We present an algorithm that reduces estimation errors in chemical speciation calculations by means of the use of redundant data. Redundant data are measurements and assumptions that exceed the minimum required, and therefore are not strictly necessary, to speciate a water sample. The proposed method was compared with the classical speciation algorithm on two synthetic examples. Our results show that using redundant data improves speciation results reducing the estimation error between computations and measurements. In fact, the larger the amount of redundant data, the better the speciation in terms of errors of the estimated concentrations.},

abstract = {The initial motion of two-dimensional capsule in microchannel flow just after release is investigated in this paper by a numerical simulation method, which combines the finite volume method with the front tracking technique. The capsule is modeled as liquid medium enclosed by a thin membrane, for which linear elastic properties are taken into consideration. Three kinds of initial capsule shapes (circle, ellipse, and biconcave) and three initial positions (center-line, near-center, and near-wall positions) are considered in the simulations. Off-center capsules (the near-center and near-wall capsules) experience tilting and membrane tank-treading, and migrate laterally while they move with the fluid flow. After initial rapid tilting, the circular and elliptic near-wall capsules reach quasistationary tilt orientation, while the biconcave near-wall capsules experience steady change in tilt orientation with time. Lateral movements of the capsules indicate the existence of lift effect causing the capsule to move away from the wall. Lift velocities, the velocity components along the transverse direction, of the circular near-wall capsules decrease as they approach the centerline, while those of the elliptic and biconcave near-wall capsules do not show this trend, which might result from the short range of the simulation time. In general, the capsule with higher membrane dilation modulus has lower lift velocity, showing the effect of capsule deformability on the capsule behavior. Both tank-treading and lift velocities are 1-2 orders lower than the capsule translational velocity. For the circular and biconcave capsules, no matter the center-line or off-center capsules, hematocrit ratio increases with the membrane dilation modulus, namely, the capsule moving velocity decreases with the increasing dilation modulus, while the elliptic capsules with nondimensional membrane dilation moduli of 2500 and 500 show inverse trend in some time range. A preliminary study is carried out for long-term simulation of a circular capsule.},

@article{Saar2011,
abstract = {A review of coupled groundwater and heat transfer theory is followed by an introduction to geothermal measurement techniques. Thereafter, temperature-depth profiles (geotherms) and heat discharge at springs to infer hydraulic parameters and processes are discussed. Several studies included in this review state that minimum permeabilities of approximately 5×10−17 {\textless} k min {\textless}10−15 m2 are required to observe advective heat transfer and resultant geotherm perturbations. Permeabilities below k min tend to cause heat-conduction-dominated systems, precluding inversion of temperature fields for groundwater flow patterns and constraint of permeabilities other than being {\textless}k min. Values of k min depend on the flow-domain aspect-ratio, faults and other heterogeneities, anisotropy of hydraulic and thermal parameters, heat-flow rates, and the water-table shape. However, the k min range is narrow and located toward the lower third of geologic materials, which exhibit permeabilities of 10−21{\textless} k {\textless}10−7 m2. Therefore, a wide range of permeabilities can be investigated by analyzing subsurface temperatures or heat discharge at springs. Furthermore, temperature is easy and economical to measure and because thermal material properties vary far less than hydraulic properties, temperature measurements tend to provide better-constrained groundwater flow and permeability estimates. Aside from hydrogeologic insights, constraint of advective/conductive heat transfer can also provide information on magmatic intrusions, metamorphism, ore deposits, climate variability, and geothermal energy.},

@article{Ren2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis GroupThe rate-controlled constrained-equilibrium (RCCE) method is a thermodynamics-based dimension reduction method that enables representation of chemistry involving ns chemical species in terms of a smaller number, nr, of constraints, and thus reduces the computational burden imposed by detailed chemical kinetics. The accuracy in the reduced description by RCCE strongly depends on the specification of constraints. In this work, the connection between the RCCE method and the conventional partial equilibrium assumption (PEA) method is revisited. It is shown that with the constraints being specified based on rate-controlling slow reactions, the RCCE method is equivalent to PEA. A criterion based on time scale analysis is then employed for the identification of fast reactions. Then the importance index, which represents the contribution of individual species to the slow dynamics of a reactive system, is proposed for the selection of species constraints in RCCE. This makes the thermodynamics-based constrained equilibrium manifolds (CEMs) a good approximation to the actual kinetics-controlled slow invariant manifolds (SIMs) in reactive systems. The method is demonstrated in the reduced descriptions of perfectly stirred reactors (PSRs) burning stoichiometric methane/air mixtures. Sample reaction states ranging from near-equilibrium conditions to the extinction turning points on the S-curve are examined for the identification of fast reactions and species constraints. Reduced descriptions of transient PSRs by RCCE are subsequently performed with their accuracy assessed against the full descriptions, in which all the chemical species are transported. The study shows that the dynamics predicted by RCCE agrees well with that from the full description and that near-limit reaction states are important for the selection of species constraints in RCCE.},

abstract = {Engineered geothermal systems represent a significant unutilized energy source, with the potential to assist in meeting growing energy demands with clean, renewable energy. Traditional geothermal systems use water as the working fluid. An alternative working fluid is carbon dioxide which offers potential benefits including favorable thermodynamic and transport properties and the potential for sequestration. An important feature is that CO2 does not dissolve mineral salts, and this will serve to reduce fouling and corrosion problems which afflict piping and surface equipment in conventional water cycles. Our modeling shows that a CO2-based power plant has net electricity production comparable to the traditional approach, but with a much simpler design, and demonstrates the comparative efficacy of CO2 as a heat extraction and working fluid. While the economic viability of a CO2-based system remains to be proven, this analysis provides a starting point for more detailed thermodynamic and economic models of engineered geothermal systems power conversion utilizing CO2. 1.},

The calculation procedure is identical to WATEQ2, which has been installed on many mainframes and minicomputers. Several data base revisions have been made that include the addition of Se (-II, 0, IV, VI) and U (III, IV, V, VI) species as well as the recently published values of Nordstrom and others (1990). A new set of redox options has been introduced so that all species that would exist in a disequilibrium system can be independently calculated, or selected species can be coupled, at the desire of the user. This report provides all the reactions and references for the complete data base, instructions for program operation, and an explanation of the input and output files. Attachments contain sample output from four water analyses used as test cases, and the complete source listings for WATEQ4F, its thermodynamic data base, input data preparation program WQ4FINPT, and a batch program to run WATEQ4F. The thermodynamic mass transfer program PHREEQE and the revised version of mass balance program BALANCE (BALN INPT) also have been adapted to execute on a personal microcomputer with the same specifications as those described above.},

@article{Kulik2002,
abstract = {A Gibbs energy minimization (GEM) approach to calculate chemical equilibria involving surface complexation at the mineral-water interfaces is presented, permitting the whole continuum “aqueous speciation - heterogeneous adsorption - surface (co)precipitation - solid solution” to be modeled only in elemental stoichiometry, without additional material balance constraints for the total number of surface sites. The thermodynamic stability of surface-bound species is considered in a way similar to that of the solid-solution endmembers, gases, and aqueous species. This consideration is made possible by introducing: (1) the standard and reference states of surface species involving a single value of reference site density $\Gamma$o; (2) an expression of (electro)chemical potential linking quantities of the surface species with the amount and specific surface area of the sorbent; (3) activity/concentration relationships between aqueous sorbates and surface species, based on the surface activity terms (SAT) as functions of the maximum site densities $\Gamma$max; (4) the surface type area fractions $\phi$$\alpha$,t for describing faces or patches on heterogeneous surface of multi-site-surface sorption mineral phases; (5) an elemental stoichiometry and standard partial molal properties of the amphoteric neutral surface functional group ≡OH and derived surface complexes at ambient conditions, comparable between all (hydr)oxide mineral surfaces. For the ;OH group (in 2pKA surface complexation models), a O0.5Ho stoichiometry is conventionally defined from a reaction 0.5H2Oaq = {\textgreater}O0.5Ho, with logKn = 1.74436 (at = 20 $\mu$mol {\textperiodcentered} m−2) which is independent of temperature, pressure, pH, fO2, amount and specific surface area of the sorbent, aqueous speciation, and surface speciation. It follows that all the non-reacted {\textgreater}O0.5Ho groups have constant activity in the presence of liquid H2O and are thus macroscopically indistinguishable. The surface heterogeneity is described via standard thermodynamic properties of the surface complexes (reacted groups), such as “surface hydronium” {\textgreater}O0.5H2+, “surface hydroxyl” {\textgreater}O0.5−, adsorbed cations or anions, as well as through $\phi$$\alpha$,t and the common or individual $\Gamma$t,max parameters. Theoretical findings, implemented in the GEM-Selektor code, are illustrated by modeling the literature potentiometric titration and adsorption data for silica and rutile in NaCl solutions with the triple-layer (TLM), the generalized double-layer (DLM), and the non-electrostatic (NEM) surface complexation models (SCM). Some examples were also calculated with the FITEQL3.2 code to check for compatibility. It is shown: (1) how approximate conversions between partial molal properties of surface species and intrinsic adsorption constants can be performed for different total site densities $\Gamma$C ≠ $\Gamma$o; (2) what are the regions of “geometrically ideal” and “non-ideal” adsorption behavior for the chosen SCM and how they are controlled by the SAT = f($\Gamma$max) on heterogeneous surfaces; and (3) why different sets of TLM parameters are not thermodynamically equivalent, and how a meaningful “optimal” set can be determined from titration data. Due to the separation of $\Gamma$max parameters from $\Gamma$o and, hence, from thermodynamic constants, the thermodynamic SCMs (in GEM implementation) can provide more insight into the relationships between surface types, complexes, bulk mineral sorbent, and aqueous sorbates, therefore permitting a more thorough use of microscopic/spectroscopic data in sorption modeling than has ever been possible.},

Equilibrium at constant P and T was found by minimization of G, while equilibrium at constant P and H was found by maximization of S or minimization of - S, all with respect to the number of moles of each component in each phase. Both cases could be handled as optimization problems, satisfying the restrictions imposed by mole or atom balances, and non-negativity of number of moles. Convexity analyses were carried out, and the conditions were found in order to guarantee global minimum, for one liquid phase, one gas phase, and a number of solid phases. The minimum point was then found either by analytical methods or by direct minimization methods. These strategies were tested for a number of cases, with good results. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {AIM: To determine whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to categorize small bowel Crohn's disease (SB CD) into groups that correlate with response to medical therapy and surgical pathology. METHODS: Data was collected from all patients with MRI evidence of SB CD without significant colonic disease over a 32-mo period. Two radiologists, blinded to clinical findings, evaluated each MRI and grouped them based on bowel wall thickness and wall enhancement. These categories were: (1) "fibrosis", (2) "mild segmental hyper-enhancement and mild wall thickening", (3) "mild segmental hyper-enhancement and marked wall thickening", (4) "marked segmental transmural hyper-enhancement". Patient response to additional medical therapy post-MRI was prospectively determined at 8-wk. Non-responders underwent endoscopy and were offered therapeutic endoscopy or surgery. Surgical pathology was assessed against the MRI category. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were included. Females and category "2" patients were more likely, and patients with luminal narrowing and hold-up less likely, to respond to medical therapy (P {\textless} 0.05). Seventeen patients underwent surgery. The surgical pathological findings of fibrosis and the severity of inflammation correlated with the MRI category in all cases. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that SB CD can be grouped by the MRI findings and that these groups are associated with patients more likely to respond to continued medical therapy. The MRI categories also correlated with the presence and level of intestinal inflammation and fibrosis on surgical pathology, and may be of prognostic use in the management of CD patients.},

@article{Tutolo2015a,
abstract = {To investigate CO2 Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) in sandstones, we performed three 150°C flow-through experiments on K-feldspar-rich cores from the Eau Claire formation. By characterizing fluid and solid samples from these experiments using a suite of analytical techniques, we explored the coupled evolution of fluid chemistry, mineral reaction rates, and hydrogeochemical properties during CO2 sequestration in feldspar-rich sandstone. Overall, our results confirm predictions that the heightened acidity resulting from supercritical CO2 injection into feldspar-rich sandstone will dissolve primary feldspars and precipitate secondary aluminum minerals. A core through which CO2-rich deionized water was recycled for 52days decreased in bulk permeability, exhibited generally low porosity associated with high surface area in post-experiment core sub-samples, and produced an Al hydroxide secondary mineral, such as boehmite. However, two samples subjected to ∼3day single-pass experiments run with CO2-rich, 0.94mol/kg NaCl brines decreased in bulk permeability, showed generally elevated porosity associated with elevated surface area in post-experiment core sub-samples, and produced a phase with kaolinite-like stoichiometry. CO2-induced metal mobilization during the experiments was relatively minor and likely related to Ca mineral dissolution. Based on the relatively rapid approach to equilibrium, the relatively slow near-equilibrium reaction rates, and the minor magnitudes of permeability changes in these experiments, we conclude that CCUS systems with projected lifetimes of several decades are geochemically feasible in the feldspar-rich sandstone end-member examined here. Additionally, the observation that K-feldspar dissolution rates calculated from our whole-rock experiments are in good agreement with literature parameterizations suggests that the latter can be utilized to model CCUS in K-feldspar-rich sandstone. Finally, by performing a number of reactive transport modeling experiments to explore processes occurring during the flow-through experiments, we have found that the overall progress of feldspar hydrolysis is negligibly affected by quartz dissolution, but significantly impacted by the rates of secondary mineral precipitation and their effect on feldspar saturation state. The observations produced here are critical to the development of models of CCUS operations, yet more work, particularly in the quantification of coupled dissolution and precipitation processes, will be required in order to produce models that can accurately predict the behavior of these systems.},

abstract = {A time-space continuum model for transport of hydrothermal fluids in porous media is presented which provides for simultaneous, reversible and irreversible chemical reactions involving liquids, gases and minerals. Homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions are incorporated in the model in a similar fashion through source/sink terms added to the continuity equation. The model provides for moving reaction fronts through surfaces of discontinuity across which occur jump discontinuities in the various field variables satisfying generalized Rankine-Hugoniot relations. Reversible reactions including aqueous complexing, oxidation-reduction reactions, mineral precipitation and dissolution reactions and adsorption are explicitly accounted for by imposing chemical equilibrium constraints in the form of mass action equations on the transport equations. This is facilitated by partitioning the reacting species into primary and secondary species corresponding to a particular representation of the stoichiometric reaction matrix referred to as the canonical representation. The transport equations for the primary species combined with homogeneous and heterogeneous equilibria result in a system of coupled, nonlinear algebraic/partial differential equations which completely describe the evolution of the system in time. Spatially separated phase assemblages are accommodated in the model by altering the set of independent variables across surfaces of discontinuity. Constitutive relations for the fluid flux corresponding to primary species are obtained describing transport of both neutral and charged species by advection, dispersion and diffusion. Numerical implementation of the transport equations is considered and both explicit and implicit finite difference algorithms are discussed. Analytical expressions for the change in porosity and permeability with time are obtained for an assemblage of minerals reacting reversibly with a hydrothermal fluid under quasi-steady state conditions. Fluid flow is described by Darcy's law employing a phenomenological expression relating permeability and porosity. Finally an expression for the local retardation factor of solute species is derived for the case of advective transport in a single spatial dimension which accounts for the effects of homogeneous and heterogeneous equilibria including adsorption on the rate of advance of a reaction front. The condition for the formation of shock waves is given.},

@article{Alberty1997a,
abstract = {The stoichiometric relations in a series of biochemical reactions are summarized by a stoichiometric number matrix (with a column for each reaction) and a conservation matrix (with a row for each constraint). These two matrices for a series or cycle of biochemical reactions are related because the columns of the stoichiometric number matrix are in the null space of the conservation matrix, and the rows of the transpose of the conservation matrix are in the null space of the transpose of the stoichiometric number matrix. The conservation matrix for a system of biochemical reactions is of interest because it shows the nature of the constraints in addition to the conservation of atoms and groups. Constraints beyond those for the conservation of atoms and groups indicate "missing reactions" that do not occur because the enzymes involved couple reactions that could occur and still conserve atoms and groups. The interpretation of conservation matrices and stoichiometric matrices for a reaction system is complicated by the fact that they are not unique. However, their row-reduced forms are unique, as are their dimensions, which represent the number of reactants and number of independent reactions. Two matrices that look different contain the same information if they have the same row-reduced form. The urea cycle, which involves five enzyme-catalyzed reactions, and its net reaction are discussed in terms of the linear constraints produced by enzyme catalysis. A procedure to obtain a set of conservation equations that will yield the correct net reaction is described.},

abstract = {Rate-controlled constrained equilibrium provides a sound framework for deriving and testing low-dimensional models of combustion chemistry, yet its application so far has been limited. The purpose of this paper is twofold: to propose a formulation of RCCE as a differential-algebraic problem and show how existing formulations such as the constraint potentials can be derived from it, and to demonstrate how combustion problems involving flow, such as nonpremixed laminar flames, can be solved with RCCE. A 9-constraint set is employed to reduce a 63-species detailed mechanism for CH4-air combustion and is found to be sufficient for fairly accurate predictions of both ignition in a homogeneous reactor and the structure of nonpremixed laminar flames for a variety of strain rates, while the main features of the latter can also be reproduced with a 7-constraint subset. {\textcopyright} 2005 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Combustion Institute.},

@misc{Rochelle2005,
abstract = {The rate and magnitude of geochemical reactions can be described by two main processes; thermodynamics which determines the end point of reaction (i.e. approach to equilibrium conditions), and kinetics which determines how rapidly the reaction proceeds. There have been many studies that have investigated equilibrium conditions and have generated a wealth of data. However, for many systems the rate at which the end point of the reaction is reached is of equal, and possibly greater importance (e.g. the behaviour of waste products stored within the geosphere or during weathering). Predictive geochemical computer modelling is becoming increasingly important for investigating many different scenarios relatively rapidly. Although such models are capable of modelling rate-controlled dissolution and precipitation, there is no standard database of kinetic functions. As a consequence, it is sometimes difficult to locate sources of information to aid modelling. The overall aim of this report, is to provide information on literature sources of mainly mineral reaction rate data. It is hoped that this will facilitate predictive modelling exercises, or laboratory experimental studies addressing gaps in data coverage. Information on the sources of literature information has been produced in the form of an EndNote electronic database (see Appendix I). This study does not however, go as far as extracting and tabulating all the individual data points within these references.},

@article{Pajarre2008,
abstract = {Computation of chemical equilibria in multiphase systems by Gibbs free energy minimization under constraints set by the material balance has increasing interest in many application fields, including materials technology, metallurgy and chemical engineering. The results are utilised in multi-phase equilibrium studies or as parts of equilibrium-based process simulation. Yet, there exist a number of practical problems where the chemical system is influenced by other constraining factors such as surface energy or electrochemical charge transport. For such systems, an extended Gibbs energy method has been applied. In the new method, the potential energy is introduced to the Gibbs energy calculation as a Legendre transformed work term divided into substance specific contributions. The additional constraint potential is then represented by a supplementary undertermined Lagrange multiplier. In addition, upper bounds on the amounts of products can be set, which then limit the maximum extents of selected spontaneous chemical reactions in terms of affinity. The range of Gibbs energy calculations can then be extended to new intricate systems. Example models based on free energy minimisation have been made e.g. for surface and interfacial systems, where the surface, interfacial or adsorbed atomic or molecular layers are modeled as separate phases. In an analogous fashion the partitioning effect of a semi-permeable membrane in a two-compartment aqueous system can be modeled. In such system the large ions, not permeable through the membrane, cause an uneven charge distribution of ionic species between the two compartments. In this case, the electrochemical potential difference between the two aqueous phases becomes calculated for the multi-component system. The calculated results are consistent with the Donnan equilibrium theory; however the multi-phase system may also include the gas phase and several precipitating phases, which extends the applicability of the new method. Finally, similar constraints can also be set to extents of reaction advancements, allowing usage of Gibbs energy calculations in dynamic reaction rate controlled systems. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Efficient separation operations and many other chemical processes depend upon a thorough understanding of the properties of gaseous and liquid mixtures. Molecular Thermodynamics of Fluid-Phase Equilibria, Third Edition is a systematic, practical guide to interpreting, correlating, and predicting thermodynamic properties used in mixture-related phase-equilibrium calculations. Completely updated, this edition reflects the growing maturity of techniques grounded in applied statistical thermodynamics and molecular simulation, while relying on classical thermodynamics, molecular physics, and physical chemistry wherever these fields offer superior solutions. Detailed new coverage includes: Techniques for improving separation processes and making them more environmentally friendly. Theoretical concepts enabling the description and interpretation of solution properties. New models, notably the lattice-fluid and statistical associated-fluid theories. Polymer solutions, including gas-polymer equilibria, polymer blends, membranes, and gels. Electrolyte solutions, including semi-empirical models for solutions containing salts or volatile electrolytes. Coverage also includes: fundamentals of classical thermodynamics of phase equilibria; thermodynamic properties from volumetric data; intermolecular forces; fugacities in gas and liquid mixtures; solubilities of gases and solids in liquids; high-pressure phase equilibria; virial coefficients for quantum gases; and much more. Throughout, Molecular Thermodynamics of Fluid-Phase Equilibria strikes a perfect balance between empirical techniques and theory, and is replete with useful examples and experimental data.
